# Classes and meta-tags
# - Shield: class can equip aegis shield and also other things i guess
# - Pierce-Def: class can penetrate high physical defense without relying on high-power weaponry
# - Elemental: class has easy access to fire/ice/lightning, may consider istory rings if no healing
# - Healing: class has easy access to things which are better than hi-potion spam
# - Staff: class can equip Healing Staff/Power Staff
# - Break-Rods: 750 blaze it
# - Inflict-Confuse: class can confuse enemies; important to blue mages
# - Inflict-Berserk: Deprecated (redundant with Staff), but we don't know if removing it altogether will break things.
# - Heavyscammer: class has an easy way to abuse Death/Petrify before assassin knife
# - Crown: class guarantees a triple crown regardless of party composition

#TODO could probably have "Area-damage" and "Single-damage" tags for classes that excel at those
