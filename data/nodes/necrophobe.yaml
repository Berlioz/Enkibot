  Generic:
  - "Necrophobe is an optional fight! The only reward is the last save point before NED, which is good, but still optional."
  - "The first phase is four 8800 HP auto-reflect Barriers, which alternate between Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga and Holy/Flare."
  - "The second phase is Necrophobe himself, with 34044 effective HP, weak to all elements, spams double physical attacks/Vacuum Waves."
  - "He'll have 44044 HP if you didn't get Excalipoor, but why would you leave Gilgamesh all alone?"
  - "Reflect Rings let you bounce spells off yourself to penetrate the Barriers' Reflect status."
  - "Similarly, it might be tempting to try and Assassin's Dagger the Barriers. Don't do it, because that Doom proc gets reflected."
  Samurai:
  - "Samurai can just !Zeninage the Barriers down at a high enough level."
  - "You might think to use !Iainuki, but the Barriers are heavy, so it won't work."
  Summoner:
  - "Air Knife boosted Syldra can easily DPS race the Barriers."
  - "If you want variety in your life, you can use Catoblepas to petrify them instead."
  - "Golem almost completely neuters Necrophobe's offense."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Remember that Comet and Meteor ignore Reflect. It'll take extra Meteors, since Necrophobe is effectively a blank target, but you'll get there."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can (still) !Release Great Dragons from the Caves to hit a random target for 9999, which will kill a Barrier."
  - "Just pray that the random target selection doesn't pick Necrophobe."
  Ranger:
  - "!Rapid Fire to fish for Killer Bow procs works fairly well, though you will inevitably 'waste' some hits on Necrophobe."
  - "Alternatively, !Rapid Fire with the Chicken Knife, since the Barriers aren't THAT beefy."
  Freelancer:
  - "The Killer Bow's death proc doesn't reflect, so that's one option for the Barriers."
  - "Don't try Death Sickles. Their Doom proc gets Reflected."
  Berserker:
  - "Don't try Death Sickles. Their Doom proc gets Reflected."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Break Blade works on the Barriers."
  - "Necrophobe is weak to every element, so pick your favorite !Spellblade."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Bouncing Break or Death off your own Reflect Ringed party member is a workable, if randomly targeted, way to kill the Barriers."
  - "Necrophobe is weak to every element, so any of the boosted -aga spells will surpass Flare."
  Chemist:
  - "Death Potion kills Barriers."
  - "Necrophobe's weakness to every element means you can Holy Breath for large amounts."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "The Barriers are level 44, so it takes three Dark Sparks to hit them with Level 5 Death."
  - "They're also heavy, so Death Claw won't work."
  - "Thanks to Reflect, your best multi-target option here is Aqua Breath."
  Bard:
  - "The Barriers only have 300 MP, so !Hide stalling (if you're not on Pixel) can run them out quickly and give you infinite singing time afterwards."
  Thief:
  - "Don't forget the Genji Armor from Gilgamesh. It's a present from him to you!"
  Cannoneer:
  - "Chaos Cannon kills Barriers."
  - "Necrophobe is vulnerable to Slow and Darkness, both of which you have Cannons for."
  Gladiator:
  - "One successful !Finisher kills a Barrier. You also have !Bladeblitz to plink them all down at once."
