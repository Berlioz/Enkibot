  Generic:
  - "20000 HP, swaps between fire/ice/thunder/physical weaknesses, always beginning weak to fire."
  - "When in elemental-weak form, has lots of physical defense and spams the NON-WEAK elements at party."
  - "When in physical-weak form, has 0 physical defense and 0 physical evasion."
  - "Your Chicken Knife wielder will always be able to pierce the physical defense."
  - "Reflect Rings make it nearly impossible to die, but mean Melusine occasionally self-heals."
  INTERSECTION Red-Mage White-Mage:
  - "Congratulations, you've found the one time in the game the !White spell Libra is theoretically useful."
  - "Melusine is also vulnerable to both Silence and Confuse. Go wild."
  White-Mage:
  - "Even beyond that, you have Shell. You can't lose."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "The Blue Mage !Scan ability will let you determine the current weakness, if you care."
  - "Aqua Rake is non-elemental, giving you a way to hit all three magic-vulnerable forms."
  - "Also, Fire Rods exist. Just break those and you'll win before the first weakness swap. No need to cast Flame Thrower, since it's just weaker."
  - "1000 Needles will do 1000 to every form, even the one that has very high magic defense."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Melusine is vulnerable to both Slow and Stop."
  - "Also, Fire Rods exist. Just break those and you'll win before the first weakness swap."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Silence Blade will always work on Melusine, which makes the fight easy to burn down."
  - "Sleep Blade also always works, which is even easier."
  - "Firaga Blade is guaranteed to hit her weakness for the first three rounds of the fight and may even do 9999 per hit, which is even easier than that."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Melusine is vulnerable to Sleep, but you can probably deal 20k with Firaga spam before the first weakness swap."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Bulettes in the desert !Release to Attack for about 4000 damage. It's not great, but there's no better option this early in World 3."
  Ranger:
  - "!Rapid Fire ignores enemy defense; spamming it with the Chicken Knife lets you ignore the actual mechanics here."
  - "(also, most of the rest of the game)"
  Knight:
  - "If you're not the Chicken Knife wielder, swap between Flametongue, Icebrand, and Coral Sword for best damage output."
  Ninja:
  - "You can move the Chicken Knife to another melee class and still deal decent damage with !Throw here."
  Bard:
  - "Alluring Air can confuse Melusine, which works as well as you think."
  - "Romeo's Ballad also works, although not for very long. You can probably get a soft lock with three dedicated !Singers."
  Summoner:
  - "While you certainly can spam Ifrit, you might be better served using your other jobs' strategies or breaking rods."
  Chemist:
  - "Take advantage of Melusine's 0 magic defense in all three elemental forms and spam Succubus Kiss."
  Pierce-Def:
  - "Defense-piercing critical hits and Axes work well against the elemental forms."
