Kyrosiris' Least Favorite Boss:
  Metadata:
    next-node: soulcannon
    previous-nodes: ['w1_after_flight', 'crayclaw']
  Generic:
    - "The Adamantoise has 2000 HP, good magic evade, and sky-high physical defenses."
    - "It has powerful physical attacks, which you'll want to scam with back-row + mitigation/status aliments."
    - "The hard part is simply managing to get damage past its defenses."
  Break-Rods:
    - "...Unless you can just break two Frost Rods."
  Generic`:
    - "Any source of Ice damage hits its elemental weakness, bypassing its defenses."
  Ranger:
    - "Like, say, an Ice Bow you can buy in Crescent Town."
  Knight:
    - "A boss that only uses single-target physical attacks. You have !Cover. Have fun."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Adamantoise is level 20, so Level 5 Death will kill it."
  Beastmaster:
    - "It's not immune to death, so !Releasing a Bandersnatch (near Walse) to cast Blaster has a 50/50 chance of killing it."
  INTERSECTION Berserker Freelancer:
    - "It's not immune to death, so Death Sickles will eventually get there."
  Monk:
    - "Fist criticals break through physical defense. It might take a while, but it works."
  White-Mage:
    - "Blind is a godsend in this fight if you have no strong offensive option."
    - "You can also Protect everyone and leave them in the back row, since Adamantoise only physically attacks."
