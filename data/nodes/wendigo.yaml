  Generic:
  - "20,000 HP, uses physical attacks and Hurricane/Mind Blast/Confuse."
  - "Attacking the 'wrong' ones of the four does no damage. The real one always starts in the top right for the first hit, then moves to a random location when hit."
  - "They respond to multi-target attacks with an Ice-element counter."
  - "If you have Fire Rings or Ice Shields, you can just blast away to your heart's content."
  White-Mage:
  - "You can simply Shell up and heal through the counterattacks."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "With Mighty Guard and White Wind, you don't really care about the counterattacks."
  - "Learn Mind Blast while you're here, even though you'll probably never use it."
  - "Despite Wendigo's vulnerability to Sleep, its immunity to Old means that Time Slip won't work."
  INTERSECTION Red-Mage Black-Mage Mystic-Knight:
  - "Wendigo is vulnerable to Sleep. If it's asleep, it can't move or counter."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Wendigo is vulnerable to Slow."
  Ranger:
  - "!Rapid Fire isn't technically multi-target. You're good."
  Berserker:
  - "Unlike most things that counter indiscriminate attacks, since Berserker isn't multi-target, it's not actively detrimental against Wendigo."
  Beastmaster:
  - "This fight isn't great for !Release. A Dragon Aevis from the Void will do 5000 damage, but provoke counters."
  - "Four of them will still kill, you'll just eat a lot of counters along the way."
  Generic`:
  - "Attacking the correct Wendigo with a weak weapon (like unarmed fists or a Knife) will display 0 damage and still doesn't make Wendigo move."
  - "You can then unleash your strongest attack on that one, let it move, and repeat the process."
