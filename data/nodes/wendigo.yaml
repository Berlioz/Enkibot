Stoker/Wendigo:
  Metadata:
    next-node: fork_tower
    previous-nodes:
    - island_shrine
  Generic:
  - "20000 HP, uses physical attacks and Hurricane/Mind Blast/Confuse."
  - "Attacking the wrong one does no damage."
  - "They respond to multi-target attacks with an Ice-element counter."
  - "If you have Fire Rings or Ice Shields, you can just blast away to your heart's content."
  - "The real one always starts in the top right for the first hit."
  UNION Thief Shield:
  - "Thieves can steal an Ice Shield from Numb Blade enemies in this dungeon... not that they can use it themselves."
  White-Mage:
  - "You can simply Shell up and heal through the counterattacks."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "With Mighty Guard and White Wind, you don't really care about the counterattacks."
  - "Learn Mind Blast while you're here, even though you'll probably never use it.
  - "Despite Wendigo's vulnerability to Sleep, its immunity to Old means that Time Slip won't work."
  INTERSECTION Red-Mage Black-Mage Mystic-Knight:
  - "Wendigo is vulnerable to Sleep. If it's asleep, it can't move."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Wendigo is vulnerable to Slow."
  Ranger:
  - "!Rapid Fire isn't technically multi-target. You're good."
  Berserker:
  - "Unlike most things that counter indiscriminate attacks, since Berserker isn't multi-target, it's not actively detrimental against Wendigo."
  Beastmaster:
  - "This fight is awkward for !Release. The best you can do is a Dragon Aevis from the Void for 5000 damage, which will provoke counters."
  Generic`:
  - "Attacking the right Wendigo with a weak weapon (the Knife or just fists) will display 0 damage, and importantly, will not move the Wendigo."
  - "You can then unleash your strongest attack on that one, then repeat until victory."
