  Metadata:
    next-node: chicken_knife
    previous-nodes:
    - exdeath_w2
  Generic:
  - "8100 HP, Bartz and Krile only."
  - "This fight can be a pain with slow offense, since it'll spam Dischord to halve your level repeatedly."
  Staff:
  - "...Unless you had the foresight to farm a Power Staff in Meatfort. It casts Berserk when wielded."
  White-Mage:
  - "You have Berserk and Blink to make this fight trivial."
  Red-Mage:
  - "Power Staff access lets you Berserk, so at least your levels will remain intact."
  - "Antlion is also vulnerable to Old from the Ancient Sword, if you're worried about keeping up with its damage."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Mystic-Knight:
  - "Antlion is vulnerable to Sleep. Problem solved."
  Ranger:
  - "Antlion is vulnerable to Blind from the Dark Bow."
  Freelancer:
  - "Antlion is vulnerable to Blind from the Dark Bow and Old from the Ancient Sword."
  Knight:
  - "All of Antlion's actual damage comes from physical attacks. Just use !Guard."
  - "Antlion is also vulnerable to Old from the Ancient Sword if you want to add insult to injury."
  Beastmaster:
  - "If you didn't plan ahead, the only available !Release is 1016 damage from the Goblin in the trapped chest in Tule's training house."
  - "If you genuinely don't have a better option, make sure to grab a spare !Release in W2 rather than four-shotting Exdeath with Yellow Dragons."
  - "...You almost certainly have a better option. Even Whip meleeing."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "1000 Needles isn't affected by your levels. 8 and spare change will kill Antlion."
  - "Antlion is vulnerable to Old, Sleep, and Blind, so Time Slip is great and Flash is good too."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Comet provides a source of level-independent damage."
  - "Antlion is vulnerable to Old and Slow, so you can weaken it while you Comet it into oblivion."
  Ninja:
  - "Antlion is weak to water, so Water Scrolls are very effective."
