  Generic:
    - "You'll only get one discounted item at a Karnak store, so pick a pricey one.  Mythril Hammer is the most expensive item in the store."
    - "In the Matrix version, you can buy up to 99 of the discounted item at once, then resell them all to double your cash."
    - "Wild Nakks outside of Karnak are the easiest way to farm cash in world 1."
  Break-Rods:
    - "This is especially nice since the Karnak weapon shop is the only source of Rods in world 1."
    - "Stock up before setting foot in the Fire-Powered Ship. Rods make the Karnak 500 so much easier."
  Chemist:
    - "Now's the perfect time to farm Turtle Shells from Grass Tortoises (most common in the grasslands just outside the meteorite you arrived through.)"
    - "You probably want most of a full stack of 99. You can farm them again in W2 or W3, but you're here now and they only get more obnoxious to find."
    - "Succubus Kiss is going to be your main !Mix offense for most boss fights for the rest of the game. Also they're used for some other stuff like Turtle Soup."

  Blue-Mage:
    - "Wild Nakks can teach your Blue Mage the ???? spell, which is Vampire without the drain, so it is basically useless (except for costing 0 MP, which might be enough for you to care someday.)"
    - "Crew Dusts in the Fire Ship cast Flash, if you didn't get it from Headstones earlier."
  INTERSECTION Thief Ninja:
    - "Make sure to get the Moonring Blade. It does full damage from the back row and is an attack power upgrade."
  Thief:
    - "Don't skip the chest with the Thief's Gloves, which boost !Steal's success rate from 40% to 80%."
    - "Once you have them, you can steal Hi-Potions from Poltergeists to your heart's content."
    - "You can also steal Ethers from Motor Traps, which show up after you kill a Defeater when it's alone."
  Freelancer:
    - "If you have plans to steal literally anything later, don't skip the chest with the Thief's Gloves, which boosts the success rate of the Thief Knife's ~Mug proc from 40% to 80%."
    - "Yes, this is going to be ages from now, but you'd look really silly having to beat Fork Tower to come back."
