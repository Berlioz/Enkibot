Tree Exdeath:
  Metadata:
    next-node: ned
    previous-nodes:
    - necrophobe
  Generic:
  - "49001 HP. Starts with regular attacks and White Hole (inflicts both petrify and death, blocked by immunity to either)."
  - "Adds Holy and Condemn below 30000, then Meteo below 10000. Rush that last 10K HP, Meteo hurts."
  - "Spawns Neo-Exdeath on death."
  Bard:
  - "This fight continues into NED, so Bards can use the time to go capped-stats Super Saiyan now."
  - "White Hole can put a wrench in that plan - if you have the time to kill, you can !Hide until Exdeath runs out of MP."
  UNION Bard Blue-Mage:
  - "If you have Blue Mage in addition to Bard, Magic Hammer will drain Exdeath's MP a hell of a lot faster."
  Chemist:
  - "Yes, yes, on the SNES you can use Kiss of Blessing to stop NED from spawning and thus skip the final boss. Gold star. Don't."
  - "This fight continues into NED, so Chemists can use the time to go immune-to-everything-level-255 Super Saiyan now."
  Shield:
  - "Aegis Shield blocks White Hole completely, so have it on your most indispensible character."
  White-Mage:
  - "This fight continues into NED, so Shell and Protect on the party will carry over."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Mighty Guard. Mightguardmightyguardmightyguard. You can even facetank Meteo with it."
  - "...Especially after you Dark Spark him once and land a Level 2 Old."
  Ninja:
  - "Now is probably be a good time to !Throw all those legendary weapons, if you're having trouble burning the last 10k HP."
  Cannoneer:
  -  "Don't do anything cute. Anything that bypasses counters will skip NED's spawn like the Kiss of Blessing glitch."
  Monk:
  - "Killing with a !Counter will skip NED, which... honestly, is impressive, given that under 10k HP you should only be seeing Meteors."
  - "I'm pretty sure you can only get that Counter kill with a Berserk that would be breaking NED anyway, but I felt like Monk deserved a little shoutout here."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Hold your Dragon Aevises for NED."
