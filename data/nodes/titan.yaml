    previous-nodes: ['purobolos']
  Generic:
    - "2500 HP. Has beefy physical attacks, but the main threat is Earth Shaker, which deals powerful (480-540) all-target damage."
    - "Also casts Earth Shaker on death, so you need to have a way to not wipe to that. Float is the best way."
  INTERSECTION White-Mage Red-Mage:
    - "White and Red Mages can cast Confuse on Gaelicats in the North Mountain to gain Float to nullify Earth Shaker."
  Dancer:
    - "Dancers can !Dance the Tempting Tango on Gaelicats in the North Mountain to gain Float to nullify Earth Shaker."
  Bard:
    - "Bards can !Sing Alluring Air on Gaelicats in the North Mountain to get Float to nullify Earth Shaker."
    - "Stopping Titan with !Sing right before the killshot will dodge the Earth Shaker, but the timing is tight. Getting Float is better."
  Beastmaster:
    - "Beastmasters can !Control Gaelicats in the North Mountain to gain Float to nullify Earth Shaker."
    - "If you're not worried about Earth Shaker, you can !Release a Sand Bear to nearly oneshot Titan."
  Inflict-Confuse:
    - "Don't use a Tent, Cottage, Inn, or healing pot after getting Float, because they remove the status."
  Chemist:
    - "Here's your introduction to the brokenness of !Mix. Antidote + Maiden's Kiss = Levisalve to gain Float to nullify Earth Shaker."
  Freelancer:
    - "You can paralyze Titan with the Whip and then have someone else immediately deal the fatal blow to dodge the Earth Shaker, but the timing is tight."
  UNION Thief Berserker:
    - "If you have a Thief, a Berserker, and lots of patience, Titan's rare steal is a Gaia Hammer."
    - "That's literally an endgame weapon, especially if you can back up its Earthquake procs with a magic ability to pass along a magic stat."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Titan is vulnerable to slow, which helps with the damage race portion of the fight."
    - "If you have no better method, you can try to land Stop right before the killshot to dodge the final Earth Shaker, but the timing is tight."
  Summoner:
    - "Titan is vulnerable to the Remora summon's Paralyze. This is literally only time in the game it's useful."
    - "With very, very good timing, you can avoid the last Earth Shaker using it right before the killshot."
  Generic`:
    - "Failing any way to scam Earth Shaker, the only real alternative is to have enough HP to survive it."
