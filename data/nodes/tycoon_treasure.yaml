  Metadata:
    next-node: garula
    previous-nodes: ['walse_tower']
  Generic:
    - "Check a world map to see how you can get back to Tycoon Castle early with the wind drake."
    - "The treasures are mostly healing items, including two Elixirs and three Cottages."
    - "Two of those Cottages are hidden - walk into the castle courtyard, but before going in head over to the right wall and walk through a passage behind a tower."
  Staff:
    - "You'll also get a Healing Staff, which casts Cura on its attack target instead of attacking for damage."
  INTERSECTION Samurai Freelancer:
    - "You'll also get an Ashura, which is the first katana. It can critical hit and it's got good attack for this early."
  Freelancer:
    - "Freelancers also get good mileage out of the Diamond Bell, it's Back Row OK and feeds off your pretty good Magic stat."
  Summoner:
    - "This is also a good time to head to the tower behind the waterfall in Walse to get Shiva."
    - "For a free kill, break two Fire Rods dropped in Walse Tower or bought slightly later in Karnak."
  Geomancer:
    - "For all that we make jokes about GEO, the Diamond Bell's realy good this early. It's Back Row OK and feeds off your pretty good Magic stat."
