  Generic:
    - "Check a world map to see how you can get back to Tycoon Castle early with the wind drake."
    - "The treasures are mostly healing items, including two Elixirs and three Cottages."
    - "Two of those Cottages are hidden - walk into the castle courtyard, but before going in head over to the right wall and walk through a passage behind a tower."
  Staff:
    - "You'll also get a Healing Staff, which casts Cura on its attack target instead of attacking for damage."
  Samurai:
    - "You'll also get an Ashura, which is the first possible katana for samurai-havers."
  NOT Samurai:
    - "You'll also get an Ashura, which may be useful if you're in Chaos and have a Freelancer. Otherwise, it's free gil."
  Summoner:
    - "This is also a good time to head to the tower behind the waterfall in Walse to get Shiva."
    - "For a free kill, break two Fire Rods dropped in Walse Tower or bought slightly later in Karnak."
