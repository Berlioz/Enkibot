Walse/Walse Tower:
  Metadata:
    next-node: tycoon_treasure
    previous-nodes: ['magissa']
  Generic:
    - "You can grind to level 10+ on the Tower's post-save room, which gives ~50xp and Fire Rod drops."
    - "At Walse Town you can pick up a free Silver Specs in a pot in the house you need to go into the water to reach. It'll make you immune to Blind, which is better than nothing in that slot!" 
  Summoner:
    - "The waterfall behind Walse Castle has the Shiva fight, which is critical for Summoners."
    - "...but you won't have Summoner until after the next dungeon, so Shiva can wait. Come back with Fire Rods from Ricard Mages."
  Monk:
    - "If you don't mind grinding, you can farm APB until you have !Mantra."
  Knight:
    - "You can buy Iron Armor in Walse, though it's not strictly necessary since you can still cheese Garula easily with your Knight."
  Thief:
    - "Strongly consider the Kenpo Gi armors from Walse, you'll want every edge you can get for Garula."
    - "Please, please, please steal four Mythril Daggers from the Wyverns in Walse Tower."
    - "Also, buy or steal at least 60 Potions. Sorry, Garula just sucks for thieves."
    - "Thieves with !Flee have a fairly easy time getting the Elven Mantle in the basement of Walse Castle."
  NOT Thief:
    - "On GBA, you can quicksave every 28 steps to get the Elven Mantle from the castle basement."
    - "You probably don't want to bother with getting the Elven Mantle in the basement of Walse Castle yet, unless you're willing to abuse the Quicksave glitch in the GBA version. If you are, Quicksave every 28 steps and you won't encounter any Jackanapes."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "In the waterfall behind Walse Castle, you can learn Pond's Chorus from an Elf Toad left standing alone on the battlefield."
    - "Not only does it softlock Garula, it's a nice spell to have in general."
  Break-Rods:
    - "The Ricard Mages in Walse Tower can drop Fire Rods, if you snapped the free Frost Rod on Magissa and want another Rod for Garula."
