    next-node: tycoon_treasure
    previous-nodes: ['magissa']
  Summoner:
    - "The waterfall behind Walse Castle has the Shiva fight, which is critical for Summoners."
    - "...but you won't have Summoner until after the next dungeon, so Shiva can wait. Come back with Fire Rods from Ricard Mages."
  Knight:
    - "You can buy Iron Armor in Walse, though it's not strictly necessary since you can still cheese Garula easily with your Knight."
  Thief:
    - "Please, please, please steal four Mythril Daggers from the Wyverns in Walse Tower."
    - "Also, buy or steal at least 60 Potions. Sorry, Garula just sucks as Thief."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "In the waterfall behind Walse Castle, you can learn Pond's Chorus from an Elf Toad left standing alone on the battlefield."
    - "Not only does it softlock Garula, it's a nice spell to have in general."
  Thief`:
    - "Thieves have a fairly easy time getting the Elven Mantle in the basement of Walse Castle with !Flee. It's nice for your slog against Garula."
  NOT Thief:
    - "You probably don't want to bother with getting the Elven Mantle in the basement of Walse Castle yet, unless you're willing to abuse the Quicksave glitch in the GBA version."
    - "If you are on GBA, Quicksave every 28 steps and you won't encounter any Jackanapes."
  Break-Rods:
    - "The Ricard Mages in Walse Tower can drop Fire Rods, if you snapped the free Frost Rod on Magissa and want another Rod for Garula."
