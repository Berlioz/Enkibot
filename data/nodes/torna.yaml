  Generic:
    - "Most classes will not need to purchase gear in Torna to beat Karlabos, but it's cheap."
  Beastmaster:
    - "If you plan on releasing it against the Antlion, don't open the Goblin-trapped chest in the Training House."
  Bard:
    - "Play the piano in the Torna pub for your Bard."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "You can revisit Faris' hideout now and learn Vampire from the bats there."
    - "Also, you should definitely get Aero from the Moldwynds in the Wind Shrine and probably also Goblin Punch from the Black Goblins."
    - "The next boss is level 5 if you want to specifically match levels for the 8x Goblin Punch damage bonus."
  White-Mage:
    - "To save yourself some gil, don't forget the hidden Staff in the lower-right corner of Floor 4 of the Wind Shrine."
