    - "If you plan on releasing it against the Antlion, don't open the Goblin-trapped chest in the Training House."
  Bard:
    - "Play the piano in the Torna pub for your Bard."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "You can revisit Faris' hideout now and learn Vampire from the bats there."
    - "Also, you should definitely get Aero from the Moldwynds in the Wind Shrine and probably also Goblin Punch from the Black Goblins."
    - "The next boss is level 5 if you want to specifically match levels for the 8x Goblin Punch damage bonus."
