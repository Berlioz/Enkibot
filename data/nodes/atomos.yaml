Atomos:
  Metadata:
    next-node: ghidos_cave
    previous-nodes:
    - barrier_tower
  Generic:
  - "19997 HP, spams Comet until someone dies, then starts sucking them in."
  - "You can come in with someone dead to skip the Comets, or just leave one party member dead after them."
  - "Revive your corpse just before they move far enough to the left to get eaten and let Atomos kill someone else to buy more time. This fight is hard to lose."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Dark Spark -> Level 5 Death ends the fight."
  - "You can inflict Sleep with Time Slip on Pixel, but not on other versions because Atomos is immune to Old."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Mystic-Knight Red-Mage:
  - "Atomos is weak to Sleep, and then you can kill it without waking it up."
  INTERSECTION Knight Freelancer:
  - "You can attack with the Sleep Blade to put Atomos to sleep, then kill it if you have any magical damage (including rod snaps!) Otherwise, it doesn't really matter."
  Beastmaster:
  - "!Releasing a Lesser Lopros from the river by the Moogle Village will deal 5000 damage with Breath Wing."
  - "Four of them will kill Atomos."
  - "It's also magical damage, in case you're using Sleep strats and don't have !Catch on everyone yet."
  Generic`:
  - "Most parties without access to Sleep or !Blue can simply win a DPS race here."
  Bard:
  - "The Dream Harp doesn't work on Heavy targets, like Atomos. But you have Swift Song to buff the rest of your party!"
