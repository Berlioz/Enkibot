  Blue-Mage:
    - "The turrets you fight before Soul Cannon can teach you Missile and Flamethrower."
    - "The latter is exactly as powerful as Fira, so it's a very solid damage option with a Flame Rod equipped."
  Generic:
    - "12500 HP, weak to lightning, charges up and then casts Wave Cannon, and casts get faster after the first."
    - "Wave Cannon deals 50% of the party's max HP and inflicts HP Leak."
    - "The real danger is the Launchers. Each of them has 800 effective HP and can inflict Old. And they're in the back row on Pixel, for some reason."
    - "Try to kill the Launchers quickly to avoid having your whole party delevelled and slowed into uselessness."
  Blue-Mage`:
    - "You can Level 5 Death the Launchers."
  Break-Rods:
    - "It'll take two rods (of any flavor, since they have no weakness) to kill the Launchers, unless you've been grinding."
  Summoner:
    - "Or just cast boosted Ramuh, dealing good damage to the Cannon as well."
  Ninja:
    - "Thunder scrolls work especially well on Soul Cannon itself."
  White-Mage:
    - "Parties with !White can get through this slowly by using Esuna to cure Old and healing after Wave Cannons."
    - "Note that Esuna doesn't undo the level loss caused by Old! Cure the status effect ASAP to minimize the damage."
  Knight:
    - "Coral Swords hit Soul Cannon's Lightning weakness."
  Geomancer:
    - "All you'll get in this fight is Wind Slash! Awesome! ...except Soul Cannon and the Launchers are immune to wind."
    - "Yes, Geomancers are completely useless here aside from knife/bell attacks."
    - "The best Elixir grind spot is in the Ship Graveyard, inside the shipwreck after the Save Point, where the World Map was. You'll need them."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Stop from a Time Mage will work on the Launchers, if for some reason you're allergic to rod abuse."
    - "Soul Cannon itself is vulnerable to Slow."
  Bard:
    - "This is a funny fight for Bards, since they can Romeo's Ballad lock the Launchers and Hide from the Wave Cannons."
    - That said, the best Elixir grind spot is in the Ship Graveyard, inside the shipwreck after the Save Point, where the World Map was. You still might need them."
  Beastmaster:
    - "You may be able to rush the Soul Cannon down with four Bearagas (~9k damage) plus some attacks."
    - "If you have a way to damage it, you could !Capture a Prototype and release it for ~1k all-target damage to deal with the Launchers in one shot, but that's a big if there."
  Generic`:
    - "All damage in this fight is percentage-based, so armor does nothing. Consider unequipping it to lower your Equip Weight to 7 or below to act slightly faster."
