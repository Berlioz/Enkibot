  Metadata:
    next-node: bearaga
    previous-nodes: ['chocobo_forest']
  Generic:
    - "3000 HP, can use Fight or Quicksand (~50 party damage and HP Sap)."
    - "Physically attacking the wrong hole triggers a Gravity counterattack."
  Break-Rods:
    - "The game tells you not to use magic here. You can still break rods, receiving two counterattacks."
  Berserker:
    - "Berserkers will repeatedly wipe your party here by being stupid. Kill or blind yours before coming into the fight."
    - "If you have 4 berserkers, my condolences. Level 35 is the recommended minimum, 38 is easier, 40 should be more than enough."
    - "If you're on mobile, Berserkers will always attack the front target. This balances out to be just as stupid."
  Ninja:
    - "Thrown Scrolls will work just fine on the Sandworm. Water is no more effective than Flame or Thunder, so use whichever."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "The Dhorme Chimera in the desert south of Karnak can teach you Aqua Breath, which will nearly one-shot the Sandworm."
  Beastmaster:
    - "The Dhorme Chimera in the desert south of Karnak casts Aqua Breath on !Release, which will nearly one-shot the Sandworm."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Sandworm is vulnerable to Slow. You can do that first or just skip straight to breaking rods, your choice."
  NOT Healing:
  - "Unless you have very good healing, you will probably want to focus entirely on damage to win this."
