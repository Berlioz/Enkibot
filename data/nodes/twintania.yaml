    previous-nodes:
    - halicarnassus
  Generic:
  - "It's not Heavy and has no status resistance at all when charging Giga Flare. You have the Assassin's Dagger."
  - "Just turtle up to avoid its counterattacks and get the Dagger proc to kill it instantly when it changes form."
  - "If you're having trouble surviving, you can equip a Coral Ring and physically attack to heal for free off the counterattack."
  Break-Rods:
  - "The Wonder Wand from Fork Tower can be cycled all the way to casting Death... but you'll *probably* get blown up by hubris this way."
  - "<@CarbyBot> Oh my god, the Wonder Wand missed! (#25)"
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Holy Blade and Break Blade both work on the charging form."
  Summoner:
  - "Catoblepas and Odin both work on the charging form."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Banish and Stop both work on the charging form."
  Beastmaster:
  - "An Executor from the Solitary Island Shrine casts Level 5 Death on !Release, which works on the charging form."
  - "If you didn't pick one up earlier, using the Assassin's Dagger will be faster than walking out for one."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Level 5 Death works on the charging form."
  Thief:
  - "Steals vary by form: normal form has a Flame Shield and charging form has the second Titan's Axe."
  UNION Thief Berserker:
  - "Despite having a Berserker, you STILL probably don't care about the second Titan's Axe."
  Samurai:
  - "If for some reason you still need it, the charging form can rarely drop a Murasame when killed."
  - "!Iainuki works on the charging form."
  INTERSECTION Ranger Freelancer:
  - "Killer Bow works on the charging form."
  Cannoneer:
  - "Chaos Cannon works on the charging form."
  Red-Mage:
  - "You can put Reflect Rings on everyone, then Dualcast any offensive spell on the first form to bait out Mega Flare counters to bounce."
  White-Mage:
  - "While White Mages can't wield the Assassin's Dagger, Twintania's weak to Holy and Reflect Rings bounce its Mega Flare counters."
  - "Or just use another party member with the Dagger. I assume you have one."
  Monk:
  - "Boy, I hope you don't have four monks, because they're literally useless without someone else's skills here. Attacking triggers Tidal Wave, so wear Coral Rings."
  Oracle:
  - "Oracle can't wield the Assassin's Dagger. If you have nothing but Monks and Oracles, break out the Coral Rings. Otherwise, the Dagger works."
