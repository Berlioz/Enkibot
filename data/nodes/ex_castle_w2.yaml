Ex Death's castle (Galuf's world):
  Metadata:
    next-node: scrubamesh
    previous-nodes: [seal_crystals]
  Generic:
  - "The room after the first save point has tons of dragons - can be hard but also good XP."
  - "After the second save point is not a good grinding spot (you can't return without going throuh lava)."
  - "For the floor puzzle with the skull trapdoors, use this handy picture: https://www.cavesofnarshe.com/ff5/images/walkthrough/trapfloor.png"
  NOT Healing:
  - "If you don't have cure, you will probably want to grind at least one level at this point."
  Staff:
  - "To save yourself time in world 3 and open up some Triple Crown options, farm a Power Staff drop from Black Warlocks."
  - "It casts Berserk on hit, which has a number of obscure but quite useful applications. Especially on Shinryu."
  UNION Staff Thief:
  - "Your Thief can also rare steal a Judgment Staff from those same Black Warlocks. It casts Dispel when used. You likely don't care, but might."
  Shield:
  - "Shield-users will appreciate the Ice Shield in a chest here... or at least they would, if not for the Aegis Shield."
  - "Still, if you have multiple shield-users, it's the next best option so far."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Magic Dragons cast three Blue Magic spells you theoretically could have, but may have missed."
  - "Aeroga, Off-Guard, and Level 2 Old were all annoying to obtain the first time around, if even possible for your team."
  - "On GBA, quicksaving on floor 4 will give you an uncommon encounter with three Magic Dragons and some trash, to up your odds."
  - "Without prior confusion access, using Tempting Tango from the Dancing Dagger on a Hellraiser is your first chance to get White Wind as well."
  Ranger:
  - "You'll have to walk through the lava to get the Hayate Bow here. Consider Quicksave to do it safely on GBA. Even without that, it's worth it."
  UNION Ranger Berserker:
  - "...Especially if you put Equip Bows on a Berserker and give it to them."
  Knight:
  - "The Icebrand isn't very good, but in conjuction with your new Ice Shield it lets your Knight heal themselves."
  INTERSECTION Ninja Thief:
  - "Ninjas and Thieves will appreciate the Twin Lance weapon in a chest near the end, especially if it's your best Chicken Knife option."
  Summoner:
  - "Summoners can get the Carbuncle summon by defeating it in just before the final save point."
  - "Carbuncle is really sturdy, but transforms into a weaker healing form after casting 3 spells on you."
  - "The healing form is not Heavy (is vulnerable to Stone). Wait to see Cura and then cast Catoblepas."
  - "Catoblepas can be helpful against Twin Tania if you don't have access to other status or kill effects (but you can also get Odin later for that)."
  NOT Summoner:
  - "There's no real point to fighting Carbuncle if you don't have Summoner; it can be a pretty hard fight and Reflect Rings were more easily farmed back in Barrier Tower."
  Thief:
  - "Lazy people with a Thief may want to fight Carbuncle, because it has two common steal Reflect Rings, one from each form."
  - "Reflect Mages, common on floor 3, have a rare steal Reflect Ring and no common steal. Here's your farming place for the rest of the party!"
  NOT Healing:
  - "Players with weak healing options should consider reading Exdeath's AI script to be ready for Zombie Breath, which can spell a wipe for parties at low HP when it's cast."
