  Generic:
  - "Most groups will simply want to blast through the Void on the way to NED."
  - "The last Gilgamesh fight is basically just a victory lap."
  - "He has 7000 effective HP and only uses unimpressive physical attacks."
  Shield:
  - "He has a Genji Shield to steal/Thief Knife, but Aegis Shields are better."
  Generic`:
  - "The vast majority of trash encounters in the Void are brutal; most groups should just run."
  - "XP/ABP/gil are generally easier to get back in the first room of the Castle."
  Thief:
  - "Crystal Dragons in the Void have Elixirs as their common steal (!!). Stock up."
  - "You likely have no more use for them, but more Bone Mails can be stolen from Necromancers."
  NOT Thief:
  - "You can use the Thief Knife to steal Elixirs from Crystal Dragons at this point, if you need more."
  Generic``:
  - "Of note: the random encounter with 3 Movers is 199 AP per fight - but you have to win before they run away."
  - "They're Heavy, Undead, and vulnerable to Fire."
  Summoner:
  - "If you actually bothered to get Phoenix for your Summoner, now's a good chance to just explode them all."
  - "If not, Ifrit is probably still enough when backed with Hermes Sandals-level speed."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Mystic-Knight:
  - "Firaga/Firaga Sword will make quick work of them."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can !Control them and force them to suicide."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Time Mages can land Slowga on the Movers and just win by burning them down."
  Bard:
  - "Bards can vaporize the Movers easily with Requiem, since they're Undead."
