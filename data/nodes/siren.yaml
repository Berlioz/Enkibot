  Metadata:
    next-node: north_mountain
    previous-nodes: ["ship_graveyard"]
  Generic:
    - "900 HP; switches between a high-magic-defense human form and a high-physical-defense fire-weak undead form."
    - "Siren is Heavy, so no getting cheeky with Phoenix Down on the undead form."
  NOT White-Mage:
    - "Even without !White, you can damage the undead form for 50 HP a shot with Potions."
  White-Mage:
    - "You can use Cure to deal big damage to the undead form."
    - "The Flail ignores defense, which means you can actually also do some pretty nice damage to the human form."
    - "Remember that the Flail can be used from the back row at 100% damage."
  Black-Mage:
    - "The undead form is weak to Fire."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Don't try to use Vampire on the Undead form. The results are as predictable as they are unfortunate."
  Monk:
    - "Fist criticals can penetrate Siren's hefty physical defense even in undead form."
