    - azulmagia
  Generic:
  - "19997 HP, casts 100 Gs to dispel Float, then spams Earth Shaker and occasionally petrifies a target."
  - "100 Gs can be reflected. Floating character + Reflect Ring means Catastrophe will literally never attack."
  - "Dancing Dagger to confuse a Gaelicat (North Mountain) or Poison Eagle (rare encounter in the Caves, feed it an Ether) for Float."
  - "Just don't use a Cottage or touch a healing pot (like the Phantom Village void one) once you're Floating."
  Time-Mage:
  - "...or just cast the Float spell with your Time Mage."
  - "While you're at it, you can Slow if you want to make the fight go slightly faster."
  Chemist:
  - "...or just use the Levisalve !Mix with your Chemist."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "...or just use Mighty Guard, which gives Float."
  - "I guess you could also cast Flash for novelty? Don't bother."
  Generic`:
  - "Of course, many parties have the HP/healing/offense to power through Earth Shakers and kill Catastrophe normally."
  - "Try it out before bothering with Float cheese if you want to potentially save time."
  Beastmaster:
  - "For instance, !Releasing two Great Dragons will kill Catastrophe. Because they do 9999."
  Cannoneer:
  - "Catastrophe is vulnerable to Slow and Old if you're going to just power through."
