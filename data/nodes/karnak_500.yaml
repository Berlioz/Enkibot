  Metadata:
    next-node: library
    previous-nodes: ['liquiflame']
  Generic:
    - "You have ten minutes to get as much loot out of the Karnak 500 as possible. (Karnak 1000 just doesn't roll off the tongue as easily)"
    - "Take the opportunity immediately after you kill Liquid Flame to set your jobs and abilities. The Karnak timer keeps ticking even in the menu."
    - "It's best to look up a map if this is your first time. There's a decent one on GameFAQs at https://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/562810-final-fantasy-v/faqs/49618?raw=1"
    - "If you're having trouble with the Sergeant + Cur Nakk encounter, kill the Sergeant to make the dogs run away."
  INTERSECTION White-Mage Red-Mage:
    - "You can also Confuse the Sergeant, which stops him from telling the Curs to attack."
  Knight:
    - "RUN RUN RUN. No, the Brave Blade isn't worth it. Never take the Brave Blade."
    - "You demolish chest enemies with Two-Handed attacks, if you have it."
  Thief:
    - "If your offense is good, you can steal plenty of Elixirs from the Gigas enemies in every trapped chest."
    - "Remember, you can !Flee from trapped chests and re-open them again to steal again! This is your best use of any remaining time after you've beaten Iron Claw but before you leave the area."
    - "You should also common-steal some Mage Mashers from the Sorcerers in chests here."
  Generic`:
    - "Get the Elven Mantle and Main Gauche; those are the best unconditional loot in here."
  Dancer:
    - "There's also a Ribbon! Get the Ribbon! You'll need it for your Dancer! It's rad!"
  Freelancer:
    - "Freelancers can also wear the Ribbon! And should. Get the Ribbon and never take it off."
  UNION NOT Dancer NOT Freelancer:
    - "You could let the Ribbon burn since you don't have anyone to wear it, but it's bad form to not save the poor thing."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "You can learn Aera from the Gigases here for your Blue Mage, though it won't be too long until you can get it again."
    - "Since the Gigases are immune to wind themselves, parties relying on !Blue will have serious damage problems here."
    - "Consider running straight to the exit to learn Death Claw, then doubling back to clear out the trapped chests."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Red-Mage:
    - "You have the firepower (literally) to grab every chest with time to spare, if you want them."
    - "I like to farm up gil for a few rods off Wild Nakks before coming here, to extra-trivialize things."
  White-Mage:
    - "White Mages should definitely not forget about the Esuna spell in a chest here; it'll be a while until you can buy it."
  Generic``:
    - "You'll have to kill Iron Claw, a miniboss with 900 HP and some Cur Nakk friends, before you exit the castle."
  Blue-Mage`:
    - "He can teach you Death Claw, and this is the only spot to get it for a while. It's lovely against anything that's not Heavy."
    - "Don't kill the Sergeant before he transforms into Iron Claw if you want Death Claw."
  NOT Blue-Mage:
    - "Don't bother fighting it out. You can prevent Iron Claw from spawning by leaving one Cur Nakk alive and then attacking the Sergeant to death."
