  Generic:
    - "1200 HP, begins countering every attack with Rush at 800 HP."
    - "A definite trainwreck waiting to happen for unlucky and unprepared players."
  Break-Rods:
    - "Of course, you can also farm up a Fire Rod from a Ricard Mage downstairs, or use the Frost Rod from Carwen."
  Knight:
    - "Knights can cheese this fight with three critical-HP characters and one Knight using nothing but !Guard."
    - "Rush still inflicts Sap, so bring a few potions."
    - "If you already have Two-Handed, it means half as many counterattacks before you kill. Good idea."
  White-Mage:
    - "White Mages can cast Protect to make Garula's offense half as dangerous."
    - "For 4x White Mage parties, put everyone in the back row and ONLY attack with the Flail to minimize counterattacks."
    - "It's easy enough to grind out, especially with the Healing Staff. Also incredibly boring."
  Thief:
    - "4x Thief parties should have a Mythril Knife attacker in the front row and 3 Potion chuckers in the back row."
    - "Seriously, expect to burn through 50-60+ Potions if you're at a reasonable level."
    - "As a corollary, check when you get your next knife M increase on both Faris and Bartz, and maybe grind to it if it's close."
  Monk:
    - "The Monk's !Focus, which lets you hit twice as hard half as often, helps immensely with the counterattack mechanic."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Garula is weak to Frog, so you can cast Pond's Chorus, have it spend its turn curing Frog, and repeat."
    - "Blind will also work, if for some reason Frog abuse isn't enough."
