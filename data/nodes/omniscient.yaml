Minotauros + Omniscient:
  Metadata:
    next-node: sea_trench
    previous-nodes:
    - fork_tower
  Generic:
  - "Dual boss; you have to split up your parties for this."
  - "Minotaur is easy even for mages. Just whittle him down with Chicken Knife and potions."
  - "Don't be afraid to back off on dps, since Minotaur counters with more physical attacks."
  - "Don't enter the pause menu between Minotaur and Omniscient, because you WILL get a game over and you WILL feel stupid."
  - "Omniscient Resets if any non-Magic (!White, !Black, !Time, !Blue, !Summon, !Dualcast) command is used on him, unless he is Silenced or Berserked."
  - "SILENCE AND BERSERK DO NOT WORK IN THE MOBILE VERSION! DO NOT BLAME ME IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS!"
  - "Omniscient's entire offense is neutralized by Reflect Rings, but you still need a way to kill him."
  White-Mage:
  - "White Mages can Berserk on him and then spam Blink and attack him to death."
  - "The Blink part is important. Omniscient is evidently very muscular under that rug."
  Geomancer:

  Chemist:
  - "Offensive !Mixes do cause Omniscient to reset the battle."
  - "That said, you can just Berserk him first, then blind him and !Mix to your heart's content."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Silence Blade is hilariously effective."
  INTERSECTION Mime Freelancer:
  - "Even if you have no mages, you have the Power Staff for Berserk access.
  - "Just prepare to throw LOTS of Phoenix Downs before you beat Omniscient to death."
  Break-Rods:
  - "SNAPPING RODS COUNTS AS A PHYSICAL ATTACK (somehow)."
  - "...except on mobile, where !Item is not forbidden."
  Generic`:
  - "Except on mobile, the Magic Lamp will provokes Return as well."
  - "Failing any other way to do this, there are three general strategies."
  - "1) With a Reflect Ring+Mage Masher, reflect a Silence proc onto Omniscient by attacking yourself, then quickly attack him before it wears off."
  - "2) With a Reflect Ring+Bone Mail, just wait for him to impale himself on yourself. Drain does a lot of heavy lifting here."
  - "3) With a Reflect Ring, wait out his 30,000 MP. This may happen before (2) does."
  - "3.1) if you do this, you can reflect a Mage Masher proc onto him and use an Ether on him to overflow his mp down to 9999."
  - "All of these options suck and if they are your best options, you probably don't need to do Fork Tower."
  - "...unless you need to unlock Oracle, Gladiator, or Cannoneer, in which case, you have my sympathies."
  - "Also, none of these options work on the mobile or Steam releases, where your best option is using the Magic Lamp all the way through, combined with the Reflect Ring + Bone Mail damage strats."
