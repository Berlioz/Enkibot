Minotaur & Omniscient:
  Metadata:

  Generic:
  - "Minotaur is easy even for mages. Chicken Knife and potions will get you there in the end."
  - "Don't be afraid to back off on DPS, since Minotaur counters with more physical attacks but doesn't do anything nasty if you stop to heal."
  - "Minotaur absorbs Holy, so don't attack with the Excalibur or the Holy Lance."
  - "Don't enter the pause menu between Minotaur and Omniscient, because you WILL get a game over and you WILL feel stupid. I've done it. Multiple times."
  - "Omniscient casts Reset if hit with any non-Magic (!White, !Black, !Time, !Blue, !Summon, !Dualcast) command. Being Silenced or Berserked prevents this."
  - "SILENCE AND BERSERK DO NOT WORK IN THE PIXEL VERSION! DO NOT BLAME ME IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS!"
  - "Omniscient's entire offense is neutralized by Reflect Rings, but you still need a way to successfully attack."
  White-Mage:
  - "White Mages can Berserk Omniscient, then spam Blink and trade attacks."
  - "The Blink part is important. Omniscient is evidently very muscular under that rug."
  Geomancer:
  - "http://i.imgur.com/JkwTg5O.png"
  Chemist:
  - "Offensive !Mixes do cause Omniscient to reset the battle."
  - "That said, you can just inflict Berserk first, then Blind, then !Mix to your heart's content."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Summoner Time-Mage Red-Mage:
  - "With literally any job that has real damage spells, you can just damage race and heal up with items if needed."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Silence Blade is hilariously effective."
  Staff:
  - "The Power Staff proc will Berserk Omniscient. Just prepare for a brutal slugfest."
  Break-Rods:
  - "SNAPPING RODS COUNTS AS A PHYSICAL ATTACK (somehow...)"
  - "...except in the Matrix version, where !Item is not forbidden, giving you a nice strategy here."
  Beastmaster:
  - "You can !Release a Mammon and have it target a Reflected party member to bounce Berserk onto Omniscient."
  - "It's not great, but it works. Shame you can't get Mammons outside of the Rift Castle, so it's quite a hike."
  - "Theoretically, you can also attack with the Whip, get the paralyze proc, and have 30 ticks to take other offensive actions. This is a way worse strategy and also doesn't work in the Matrix version."
  Generic`:
  - "The Magic Lamp provokes Return as well, so you can't do anything fancy with it. (Unless you're on Matrix.)"
  - "Failing any other way to do this, there are three general strategies."
  - "1) With a Reflect Ring+Mage Masher, reflect a Silence proc onto Omniscient by attacking yourself, then quickly attack before it wears off."
  - "2) With a Reflect Ring+Bone Mail, just wait for Omniscient to commit suicide. Drain does a lot of the heavy lifting here."
  - "3) With a Reflect Ring, wait out all 30,000 MP. This may happen before suicide from the second strategy does."
  - "3.1) If you are going to do this, you can Reflect a Mage Masher proc and use an Ether on Omniscient. This overflows the 30,000 MP down to 9,999."
  - "All of these options suck and if they are your best options, you probably don't need to do Fork Tower."
  - "...unless you need to unlock Oracle, Gladiator, or Cannoneer, in which case, you have my sympathies."
  - "Note that none of these options work in the Matrix release, where your best option is using the Magic Lamp all the way through, combined with the Reflect Ring + Bone Mail damage strats."
