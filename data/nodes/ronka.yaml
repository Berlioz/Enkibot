  Generic:
    - "Don't hit the speed trap!"
  Chemist:
    - "This is your last opportunity with all 4 party members to farm Prototypes on the island west of Crescent for Dark Matter."
    - "You will want a total of 6 if you are Death Potioning every vulnerable boss before the next source of them (the Pyramid in W3) and you already have 1 from Soul Cannon."
    - "Prototype is vulnerable to Berserk, but you can't set Blind as well without Dragon Fangs. Mostly just kiss it to death."
  INTERSECTION Knight Red-Mage Mystic Knight Gladiator Freelancer:
    - "The Ancient Sword in a chest here is a way to inflict Old, which can come in handy for some bosses."
  UNION Dancer Thief:
    - "Dancer + Thief parties should steal a Lamia's Tiara from Lamias here, which boosts Sword Dance's proc rate."
    - "You won't wear it forever, because Ribbons and Rainbow Dresses both exist, but it has its uses for pure DPS races in the meantime."
    - "Lamia's Tiara is SIGNIFICANTLY more useful on Pixel, because it also boosts !Flirt success from 50% to 100%, and !Flirt now works on everything."
    - "You still will replace it with a Rainbow Dress later, but it's more useful in the meantime!"
  Blue-Mage:
    - "If you missed it in Karnak, the Enchanted Fan can teach you Aera."
  UNION Beastmaster Blue-Mage:
    - "A !Controlled Enchanted Fan can also teach you White Wind, which is KIND OF A BIG DEAL."
    - "You can also learn 1000 Needles from !Controlled Lamias, which is pretty handy for a few fights coming up."
  UNION Blue-Mage White-Mage:
    - "You can Confuse an Enchanted Fan to learn White Wind, which you really should since it's rad."
  UNION Blue-Mage Red-Mage:
    - "You can Confuse an Enchanted Fan to learn White Wind, which you really should since it's rad."
  UNION Blue-Mage Bard:
    - "You can Confuse an Enchanted Fan to learn White Wind, which you really should since it's rad."
  Blue-Mage`:
    - "Frankly it's a pain in the ass for a useless spell. but you can hunt down the Ghidra to learn L4 Graviga at this point too."
    - "On GBA, you can quicksave to get the rare Ghidra encounter easily. Doesn't make the spell any more useful, though."
  Thief:
    - "Enjoy the brief moment of Find Passages being relevant. It won't happen again for a while."
  UNION Thief Ranger:
    - "Ghidra have a Killer Bow as a rare steal, which you can't otherwise get until W2. Not mandatory, but good for Manticore if nothing else."
