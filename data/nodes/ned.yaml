  Generic:
  - "Image guide: https://i.imgur.com/newtN7c.png"
  - "Biggest threats are: Grand Cross (random ailments), Almagest (1620-1665 holy damage + Sap status), enrage (last part living uses every part's bad stuff, plus gets two attacks per turn.)"
  - "Grand Cross can be mitigated with Hermes Sandals, Aegis Shield, and luck. Most parties will kill Grand Cross first to lower the number of dice rolls."
  - "Almagest is a HP check. Unless you have extreme damage output and rush it first, you will need the HP (or Shell) to survive it."
  - "You can skip enrage either by counting HP and killing the last 2 parts at the same time..."
  - "...or by saving the bottom left (non-Heavy) part for last, then killing it with Odin from the Magic Lamp."
  Break-Rods:
  - "Even without !White, you get one free Shell cast from the Wonder Wand."
  Berserker:
  - "In the SNES version, there are two 'dummy' targets in the fight that will cause your Berserker to miss a lot. You will probably be better served equipping the Earth Hammer and Thornlet to underflow your magic stat."
  - "In the GBA version, the dummy targets are gone, making the Rune Axe much more reliable."
  - "In the mobile version, Berserkers attack targets in a nice orderly fashion, which is actually awful when trying to avoid enrage mode. Play around it."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Congratulations! Mystic Knights don't care about Almagest. Break Blade kills the part that casts it with 100% accuracy."
  Time-Mage:
  - "If things go seriously south, Quick is a good recovery tool to throw out two Phoenix Downs/Remedies/Elixirs in one turn."
  - "On SNES, your Meteors will be weaker than expected, due to the presence of two 'dummy' targets."
  - "If you're a gambling sort, you can try to land Old on the Almagest part at *extremely* low odds."
  - "You can also, with even more gambling (and high levels) involved, attempt to Banish the far-left piece. Not very practical, but absolutely hilarious."
  Dragoon:
  - "The Dragon Lance is super-effective against the Grand Cross part, if you're burning that one first."
  - "Almagest is telegraphed by Neo Exdeath beginning to shake, and Grand Cross is telegraphed by the warning 'The laws of the universe mean nothing!'."
  - "A well-timed !Jump can dodge each."
  Dancer:
  - "You'll probably have to look elsewhere for damage, but Equip Ribbons make Grand Cross almost completely useless."
  - "That said, the Man-Eater deals critical damage to the left-most piece (the one that dies to Magic Lamp Odin, so this tip isn't great.)"
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists want to lean on spamming Holy Breath (Dragon Fang + Holy Water). It does damage equal to your HP, which combos with Giant's Drink doubling your max HP."
  - "Between Giant's Drink and the ability to Shell the team, Chemists can neuter Almagest."
  - "Dragon's Kiss (Dragon Fang + Maiden's Kiss) also grants immunity from Grand Cross's 'HP Critical' result." 
  Samurai:
  - "You will need an obscene amount of cash to kill NED with just !Zeninage, but it's conceptually simple."
  - "If you have a way to kill them, the Movers in the last room of the void drop 50k gil each and come in packs of three."
  Thief:
  - "Remember that the weapons you can steal off of NED's parts (Ragnarok, Dragon Lance, Murakumo) can be equipped mid-battle."
  UNION Thief Ninja:
  - "...or thrown by your Ninja."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can release a Dragon Aevis for a 9999-all-target Breath Wing. 4 of them will get NED's parts real low."
  - "You can also release a Crystelle for Mighty Guard to trivialize Almagest, but catching one's a horrible pain and literally impossible without the Kornago Gourd."
  - "As long as you're under level 45, using the Dancing Dagger in the back row against a Crystelle that you have !Controlled to use Protect on itself first can do the necessary 2 damage."
  - "Alternatively, if you have an Excalipoor wielder, that's going to be way easier."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Mighty Guard and White Wind allow you to win stand-up brawls against NED with little fuss."
  - "Or you could abuse Dark Spark and L5 Death, but honestly it's not really worth the setup time and Dark Spark missing."
  UNION Blue-Mage Chemist:
  - "Unless you have !Mix AND math both on your side, which lets you set up the hilarious QUAD SKULL by taking all parts to level 255."
  Blue-Mage`:
  - "Condemn works on the far-left piece, if you don't want to just Magic Lamp it, or if you think that telling the final boss it has 30 seconds to live is hilarious (it is.)"
  - "The top-left piece, which casts Grand Cross, can be locked down by Paralyze from Mind Blast. That said, it has 75% magic evasion and is high level, so it's likely not worth the effort."
  Bard:
  - "Apollo's Harp does 8x damage against the Grand Cross part, if for some reason your party isn't 99 speed/level 255 anyway."
  - "...but they should be, since you buffed all your stats to maximum in the Treedeath phase of the fight, right?"
  Ranger:
  - "The Melee piece (the one that chucks out 1800 damage Vacuum Waves) can be blinded by Dark Bow."
  - "On SNES, the two 'dummy' targets make !Rapid Fire less reliable."
  Summoner:
  - "An actual !Summoned Odin will not work on the bottom part, as he will use Gungnir if any enemy on the field is Heavy."
  - "Boosted Syldras can probably end this fight before it really begins. Load !Summon and Air Knives on everyone."
  Ninja:
  - "Scrolls are still good AoE if backed up by a magic ability."
  - "Now is the time to throw the legendary weapons you aren't using for good single-target damage. Fuma Shurikens are stronger, though."
  Geomancer:
  - "!Gaia will always use Wind Slash here. Boost it with Air Knife or Rune Chime, and it'll do reasonable AoE damage."
  Monk:
  - "Unless you did a lot of grinding, your fists won't do much here. Just settle for a beefy Elixir dispenser, or use some other class's secondary."
  - "HP +30% can help other classes survive Almagest, though, and an actual Monk almost always will."
  White-Mage:
  - "Shell makes Almagest a non-issue. Blink does the same for the physicals."
  INTERSECTION Summoner Black-Mage:
  - "If you're having trouble killing the Almagest piece before it kills you, you can attempt (at fairly low odds) to Petrify it."
  - "At sane levels, you've got about an 8% shot per cast. It's low, but can save you a bunch of grinding in return for a bunch of RNG."
  Black-Mage:
  - "AoE damage makes it pretty easy to kill the last two parts at the same time."
  - "If you go with this method, though, keep in mind that the far right piece has 5000 less HP than the middle pieces."
  - "Alternatively, the far-left piece has 5000 more than the middle ones, and dies to Magic Lamp Odin, so you can leave it for last on purpose."
  Red-Mage:
  - "At least you can put up Protect...?"
  - "Raise+Cura isn't the *worst*, but you're probably better off breaking rods for middling damage."
  - "Hopefully you have another class that can use !Dualcast and can pick up the slack."
  Knight:
  - "Aegis Shield protects against a few Grand Cross outcomes, and can block Almagest, but you were wearing it anyway."
  - "If you have the Defender from Fork Tower, you can use it to apply Protect to help mitigate Vacuum Wave, if you're worried."
  UNION Knight Thief:
  - "You can steal a Ragnarok in this fight, and then swap it in to wield it without having to fight Shinryu, but it's a rare steal so it may not be worth your time."
  - "...and this is relevant because if you have Knight and Thief, your odds of being able to fight Shinryu are not great."
  Freelancer:
  - "If all else fails, you have access to Apollo's Harp (top middle piece), Man-Eater (far left piece), and Artemis Bow (bottom middle piece) for 8x, 2x, and 2x !Attack damage respectively."
  - "Wearing a Ribbon is great against Grand Cross, plus you have Aegis Shield access."
  Cannoneer:
  - "The physical attack piece (far right) and the magic piece (far left) are vulnerable to Slow."
  - "All four pieces are vulnerable to Darkness, but only the far-right one actually matters, because that one physically attacks."
  - "The Almagest piece (bottom middle) is vulnerable to Old, which will completely nerf its Almagest damage."
  - "The Grand Cross piece (top middle) is a Dragon, so it will take double damage from Dragon Cannon, which might do more than Needle Cannon at sane levels."
  - "Between the Lamp, Darkness+Slow, and Old, the only piece you don't outright neuter is the Grand Cross piece... and for some reason CAN gets Aegis Shield access."
  Gladiator:
  - "Fishing for 9999 !Finisher probably averages more damage than !Bladeblitz, but either should be fine, because Gladiator has lots of weapon options and LOTS of Strength."
  Oracle:
  - "Uh... just do whatever you've been doing all game."
