    previous-nodes: ['north_mountain']
  Generic:
    - "Magissa has 650 HP and alternates between black magic and Drain or Fight. On her first turn after reaching 300 HP, she summons Forza."
    - "Forza has 850 HP and can easily one-shot a squishy character in the front row."
  White-Mage:
    - "It's possible to sandbag your way through Magissa's 200 MP before she summons Forza, if you have !White."
    - "Or you could Silence her, refresh it periodically, and not care about her MP. And also cast Protect on everyone before Forza arrives."
  Thief:
    - "Just bring a lot of potions if you have 4 Thieves. There's no real way to finesse this fight."
    - "If you're really in trouble, grind to level 16. With 4 Daggers, you can bring Magissa from 320 to dead (and skip Forza) in one set of !Fights."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Blue-Mage:
    - "You can snap the Frost Rod from Carwen here. Pushing Magissa from >300 to dead skips Forza."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "If you're not going to abuse rod snapping, your Blue Mage can blind Forza with Flash."
  Black-Mage:
    - "If you're not going to abuse rod snapping, you can also just Sleep Forza and unload on Magissa."
    - "Spells won't wake Forza up so he'll fall easily enough as well."
