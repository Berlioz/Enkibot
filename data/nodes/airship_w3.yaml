  Generic:
  - "There are a lot of interesting things to do now that you have a working Airship."
  - "Hidden in a forest on an island to the south, you can visit the Phantom Village."
  White-Mage:
  - "Arise and Dispel will both come in handy in upcoming boss fights."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Black Mages get the short end of the stick here, 'only' learning Death and Osmose."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Quick is obscene, even without Venom Rod abuse. Just bring a Gold Hairpin."
  Bard:
  - "The eighth and final piano is carefully hidden behind a secret passage in the basement. Sneaky."
  - "The composer on Crescent Island will teach you Sinewy Etude if you've played seven pianos and Hero's Rime if you've played all eight."
  Generic`:
  - "The Accessory Shop sells Hermes Sandals for 50k each. They give permanent Haste (and thus immunity to Slow, Stop, Paralyze, and Sleep) and are easily the best accessory in the game."
  - "There's a free pair late in the Rift... but still buy all 4 now, rather than waiting, if you can afford them."
  - "Don't forget the Thief Knife behind the bar, which gives every party access to !Steal."
  - "You can grab Boko back from where you parked him near Ghido's Cave."
  - "Ride Boko all the way to the top of Istory Falls to find the Magic Lamp, which can one-shot part of the final boss."
  - "It summons a summon when used in battle, starting from strongest to weakest before looping."
  - "Examine the waterfall again to bring the Magic Lamp back to the beginning of its cycle if you need to use it for multiple bosses."
  - "While you're on Boko anyway, ride him around the entire world, then talk to a NPC in Phantom Village for your free Mirage Vest."
  - "The Accessory Shop sells Hermes Sandals for 50k each."
  - "They grant Haste and Stop immunity, and are easily the best accessory in the game."
  - "There's a free one late in the Rift... but still buy 4 now, rather than waiting, if you can afford them."
  Summoner:
  - "In Faris' old hideout, you can get the Syldra summon. When boosted with the Air Knife, it's the strongest summon in the game."
  - "You can also visit Bal Castle's basement to get the Odin summon, but it's not that useful."
  UNION Summoner Chemist:
  - "The Elemental Power mix actually does boost Water, so Leviathan will come out on top, but you have Chemist, so whatever."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Blue Mages can (and should) learn Mighty Guard from Stingrays, a rare encounter in the water south of the huge desert."
  - "You'll have to Confuse it with !White/!Mix/the Dancing Dagger."
  UNION Blue-Mage Beastmaster:
  - "You can also use !Control to learn Mighty Guard. How lucky!"
  Beastmaster:
  - "The Stingray, a rare encounter in the water south of the huge desert, drops the Dragon Whisker, the strongest whip in the game."
  - "Of course, it's a rare encounter and a rare drop, so you may want to skip it."
  INTERSECTION Blue-Mage Beastmaster:
  - "GBA players (NA version only) can use the Quicksave trick to find guaranteed Stingrays."
  Beastmaster`:
  - "!Release a Zombie Dragon to poison it, then hold it down with !Control and watch it slowly bleed out. You monster."
  Dancer:
  - "Dancers (and other Equip Ribbon-havers) will appreciate the Ribbon that the girl in the Regole equipment shop gives you."
  - "You almost certainly want to stop by Phoenix Tower to common-steal a Rainbow Dress from Parthenope (with the Thief's Knife if you don't have THF) so that you can Swords Dance half the time you !Dance."
  - "This is why you don't care about Lamia's Tiara or Red Slippers, because Ribbons and Hermes Sandals are strictly better. But one Dress per Ribbon-wearer will serve you until endgame."
  Freelancer:
  - "Freelancers will appreciate the Ribbon that the girl in the Regole equipment shop gives you."
  Red-Mage:
  - "While RDM can't summon Phoenix, everything in Phoenix Tower is vulnerable to Toad, and the Magic Pots alone get you halfway to !Dualcast."
  - "Might be a good idea if you're specifically planning to grind for !Dualcast."
