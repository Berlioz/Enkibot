  Generic:
  - "If you have strong AoE, the 2x Sword Dancer + 2x Death Claw encounter in the lobby is easy experience and ABP."
  - "Make sure you grab a Hermes Sandals from a treasure chest in the Castle; if you only had 3, there you go."
  - "The room after the first save point has tons of dragons - can be hard but also good XP."
  - "After the second save point is not a good grinding spot and you can't return without going throuh lava."
  NOT Healing:
  - "if you don't have cure, you will probably want to grind at least one level at this point."
  NOT Dancer:
  - "The fights with the old men in the downstairs cells that turn into Jura Aevises is optional and pointless without a Dancer."
  Dancer:
  - "If you still need Red Shoes or Rainbow Dresses, there's one of each in the downstairs cells if you fight the Jura Aevises."
  Generic`:
  - "Iron Giants are common in random encounters here. They're worth 10k experience each but are relatively tough."
  - "They only use physical attacks, but hit hard. They're vulnerable to Death and Petrify."
