Dimension Castle:
  Metadata:
    next-node: azulmagia
    previous-nodes:
    - apanda
  Generic:
  - "If you have strong AoE, the 2x Sword Dancer + 2x Death Claw encounter in the lobby is easy experience and ABP."
  - "You can grab a Hermes Sandals from a treasure chest in the Castle, but you should already have your full 4, because gil is best used for shoes."
  NOT Dancer:
  - "The fights with the old men in the downstairs cells that turn into Jura Aevises are optional, and also pointless without a Dancer."
  Dancer:
  - "If you still need Red Shoes or Rainbow Dresses, there's one of each in the downstairs cells if you fight the Jura Aevises."
  - "And don't forget the Man-Eater, because it's better than everything else a Dancer can wield that isn't the Chicken Knife."
  UNION Monk Dancer:
  - "Somehow, because you have both Monk and Dancer, you can give the Monk a real weapon, since Equip Ribbons gives Man-Eater access and it's great."
  UNION Dragoon Dancer:
  - "Despite its sprite, the Man-Eater deals double damage with !Jump like a spear. Except on Pixel, where it doesn't... for some reason. Just be aware."
  Generic`:
  - "Iron Giants are common in random encounters here. They're worth 10k experience each but are relatively tough."
  - "They only use physical attacks, but hit hard. They're vulnerable to Death and Petrify."
