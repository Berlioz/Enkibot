  Generic:
  - "With area damage, the upper outdoors section will give 2,000-3,000 experience per encounter."
  - "Make sure you grab a Hermes Sandals from a treasure chest in the Castle; if you only had 3, there you go."
  Dancer:
  - "If you still need Red Shoes or Rainbow Dresses, there's one of each in the downstairs cells if you fight the Jura Aevises."
  - "And don't forget the Man-Eater, because it's better than everything a Dancer can wield that isn't the Chicken Knife."
  UNION Monk Dancer:
  - "Somehow, because you have both Monk and Dancer, you can give the Monk a real weapon, since Equip Ribbons gives Man-Eater access and it's great."
  Generic`:
  - "Iron Giants are common in random encounters here. They're worth 2,5k experience but are tough."
  - "They only use physical attacks, but hit hard. They're vulnerable to Death and Petrify."
