  Generic:
  - "Anyone with a caster should make sure to get the Gold Hairpin in a trapped chest on the left side of Floor 9, which halves MP consumption."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Blue Mages can learn Time Slip from Travelers, though it's of somewhat limited utility."
  - "Level Trickers can cast Level 4 Graviga here, if you missed it from Ronka."
  Thief:
  - "Thieves can rare steal Flame Rings from the Red Dragons in the Gold Hairpin and Blood Sword chests."
  - "Remember, you can flee from a monster-in-a-box to reset the encounter if your steal fails."
  - "...or if you're crazy and want 4 of them, or even more to sell for gil, all while grinding out escapes for the Chicken Knife."
  Generic`:
  - "Almost every party should farm Reflect Knights for their Reflect Ring drops here. You'll likely need them for World 2 Exdeath."
  - "The best place to farm them is outside between floors 5 and 6, but if you need to return to the sub to heal frequently the balcony between 3 and 4 is pretty good too."
  Blue-Mage`:
  - "You have L2 Old -> L5 Death to kill W2 Exdeath, and can safely skip Reflect Rings altogether. Maybe get one for Catastrophe."
  Beastmaster:
  - "You have !Release to kill W2 Exdeath, and can safely skip Reflect Rings altogether. Maybe get one for Catastrophe."
  Chemist:
  - "Since you have Chemist, you don't need Reflect Rings for W2 Exdeath, though they're still nice. Be sure to get one if you're going to go toe-to-toe with Omega via !Mix."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Drain bypasses Reflect, so you can farm your first Reflect Ring with Drain and then bounce Breaks off your own party for the rest."
  Thief`:
  - "No point in Thieves farming Reflect Rings here. You can steal them from Carbuncle and Reflect Mages more easily before you need them."
