  Generic:
  - "It's pretty rare for any Fiesta party to care about the Deep Sea Trench. Consider skipping it."
  - "That said, it's the only location to recharge your Magic Lamp (and also the place it was first found in)."
  INTERSECTION Oracle Cannoneer Gladiator:
  - "It's also required to unlock Oracle, Cannoneer, and Gladiator."
  Bard:
  - "Bard parties might appreciate the Trench solely for the novelty of vaporizing its 100% undead inhabitants with Requiem."
  - "Not a bad way to grind out XP/AP/gil, but with Bard you don't need that much grinding."
  Monk:
  - "Monks can get the Kaiser Knuckles here, which turns their damage from pathetic to pretty bad."
  - "It also competes for the accessory slot with Hermes Sandals, making it useless."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Meteor is locked behind the Deep Sea Trench, which makes it worth doing for Time Mages."
