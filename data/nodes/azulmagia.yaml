Azulmagia:
  Metadata:
    next-node: catastrophe
    previous-nodes: [ex_castle_void]
  Generic:
  - "27900 HP, casts only !Blue spells."
  - "Go in with an odd level not divisible by 5 (don't worry about L3 Flare) to neuter the Level X spells."
  - "Technically optional, since the fight reward is a save point."
  Break-Rods:
  - "Azulmagia is weak to poison, so you can just snap a ton of Poison Rods and call it a day."
  - "The Wonder Wand will also let you cast a single Reflect, which does good work against Mighty Guard (including giving you a bonus Float before Catastrophe)."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Azulmagia is weak to poison, so Bio !Spellblade is the way to go."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Your Blue Mage can actually 'teach' Azulmagia new !Blue spells, which will then get tested on you."
  - "You can teach Self-Destruct to end the fight in one round."
  - "But first, check whether you want to learn anything here."
  - "If your party is divisible by level 3, you have Reflect Rings, and you want an even funnier kill, try teaching Level 3 Flare."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Great Dragon still does 9999 per !Release here."
  White-Mage:
  - "You can Reflect Azulmagia even without the Wonder Wand. This gives you Float from a Wonder Guard cast if you don't want to muck around with Confuse before Catastrophe."
