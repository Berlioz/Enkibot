  Metadata:

    - exdeaths_castle
  Generic:
  - "27900 HP, casts only !Blue spells."
  - "Go in with an odd level not divisible by 5 (don't worry about L3 Flare) to neuter the Level X spells."
  - "Technically optional, since the fight reward is a save point."
  Break-Rods:
  - "Azulmagia is weak to poison, so you can just snap a ton of Venom Rods and call it a day."
  - "The Wonder Rod will also let you cast Reflect, which does good work against Mighty Guard."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Azulmagia is weak to poison, so Bio !Spellblade is the way to go.
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Your Blue Mage can actually 'teach' Azulmagia new !Blue spells, which will then get tested on you."
  - "You can teach Self-Destruct to end the fight in one round."
  - "But first, check whether you're missing any good !Blue spells you can learn here."
  - "If your party is divisible by level 3, you have Reflect Rings, and you want an even funnier kill, try teaching Level 3 Flare."
