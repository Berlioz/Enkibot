  Metadata:
    next-node: calofisteri
    previous-nodes: [leviathan]
    map: [world3.png]
    coordinates: [[271,243]]
  Generic:
  - "On the entrance, 5 Ammona gives around 3,000 gil, 1,500 XP and 4 ABP, with easy access to outside."
  - 'enki.bot/odin room has better ABP farm (or maybe enki.bot/phoenix_tower if you desperately need ABP)!'
  - "Ideally, once you in deeper, you're in for good. Spend all your gil now, especially on consumables!"
  - "There is a HP/MP/Wounded healing drink close by at stasis Mirage so you may want to farm encounters."
  - "Get the Ribbon in the Forest and the Coral/Angel Rings in the Caves."
  INTERSECTION Geomancer Freelancer:
  - "You may want to pick up a rare drop Rune Chime from the Baldanders in the Ruins area. It boosts every element! Sometimes slightly useful, even if Air Knife is often just functionally equivalent."
  Time-Mage:
  - "From basically anywhere here onwards, you can Exit back to the Merged World... slow but safe."
