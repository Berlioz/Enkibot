Halicarnassus:
  Metadata:
    next-node: twintania
    previous-nodes:
    - catastrophe
  Generic:
  - "33333 HP, sky-high level (affects ailment spell accuracy)."
  - "Starts the fight by casting Ribbit to turn the entire party into frogs."
  - "Casts Holy once every eight turns; having the party Reflected will let you scam an easy kill."
  - "In general, only has single-target offense. Any party can sandbag with Phoenix Downs."
  Summoner:
  - "For whatever reason, Halicarnassus counters all offensive summons with a single-target Strong Fight for 9999 that hits through Golem."
  - "You can still just spam Carbuncle until it impales itself with Holy, though. Or use a lot of Phoenix Downs."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Red-Mage:
  - "The opening Ribbit spell just toggles Frog, so come into the fight as frogs to be cured by Ribbit and waste that turn."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Halicarnassus is vulnerable to Blind if you want to mess around with trying to land Flash. I wouldn't bother, personally."
  - "Also, the double Old and Slow vulnerability means that, for once, Time Slip actually works in this fight. That one's worth it, maybe."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Halicarnassus is vulnerable to Silence, which prevents the occasional self-buff and also Holy."
  - "That said, since Silence doesn't last that long on Heavy targets, run the numbers on just Flare Sword beatdown instead."
  INTERSECTION Freelancer Dancer:
  - "Halicarnassus is a human, so you can break out the shiny new Man-Eater from the room to the left immediately before this fight for lots of damage."
  Beastmaster:
  - "You don't have a better !Release option than Great Dragons, again, but 4*9999 > 33333 so it's no big deal."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Halicarnassus is vulnerable to Old and Slow. Sky-high magic evasion means Meteor spam is probably just better, though."
  White-Mage:
  - "Halicarnassus is vulnerable to Mini and Silence, but you'll have a hard time landing them."
  - "Instead, take advantage of all the attacks being single-target and spam Raise."
  Chemist:
  - "You can set Darkness on Halicarnassus easily, since Dark Sigh doesn't care about magic evasion or the target's level."
  - "...except on mobile, where Dark Sigh got 'fixed' to be blockable. You've been warned."
  Cannoneer:
  - "Halicarnassus is vulnerable to Mini, Old, Darkness, and Slow, all of which your Cannons can set."
  - "Mini's only benefit is doubling evade, and Halicarnassus naturally has 0, and 2*0=0, so..."
