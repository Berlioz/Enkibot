  Generic:
  - "Optional superboss; there is no reason other than bragging rights (and a nice heart on your fiesta page) to try this."
  - "Generally a lot more possible than Omega - there's a lot of ways to hurt Shinryu, so the only real question is how not to die."
  - "Coral Rings to absorb the opening Tidal Wave is mandatory for a straight-up fight..."
  - "...unless you are using Berserk strategies, in which case literally every job can get one turn before Tidal Wave with Hermes Sandals."
  - "As such, the vast majority of easy Shinryu kills involve Berserk."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Obvious exception, Quick + Venom Rod works just as well here as anywhere, if you have the patience."
  White-Mage:
  - "Anyone with !White can simply cast Berserk, of course."
  Break-Rods:
  - "Anyone who can wield a Rod can (eventually) cast Berserk with the Wonder Wand."
  Staff:
  - "Staff-users can attack with the Power Staff to apply a Berserk proc."
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists can mix Holy Water + Turtle Shell for a guaranteed Berserk."
  Beastmaster:
  - "If you don't have better Berserk options, bring at least one party member with a Reflect Ring."
  - "!Release a Mammon (caught in the Rift Castle) to cast Berserk and hope it targets the Reflected party member to bounce it to Shinryu."
  - "Once you've gotten that RNG, !Release a Galajelly from the same encounter to blind Shinryu and trivialize the fight."
  - "Also, if you want a Dragon Whisker for your Beastmaster, remember that you can run from Shinryu."
  - "There's nothing stopping you from !Stealing (or Thief Knife !Mugging) and running repeatedly. Except common sense, really."
  Generic`:
  - "You also need some way of surviving incredibly fast one-shot physical attacks."
  Shield:
  - "The Aegis Shield + mini status will boost a character's evasion % into the stratosphere."
  - "So will the Genji Shield from Gilgamesh in the Void, if you stole it. 99% Shield Evasion, baby!"
  White-Mage`:
  - "White Mages have access to Blink as well, making them perfect for this strategy."
  Knight:
  - "Knights can coverscum Shinryu the same way they can any other berserked enemy."
  INTERSECTION Freelancer Knight:
  - "Shinryu absorbs Holy, so don't hit it with the Excalibur."
  Summoner:
  - "Summoners can barely keep up with Shinryu's offense by casting Golem before every hit."
  Ninja:
  - "If you give the Ninja's !Image command to everyone, that'll work just fine."
  Chemist`:
  - "Chemists can also inflict Blind with Dragon Fang + Eye Drops."
  Ranger:
  - "Rangers can inflict blind at a flat 66% rate with Dark Bow !Attacks, since it doesn't care about level or magic evasion."
  Cannoneer:
  - "You can inflict both Berserk and Blind with your magic gun."
  - "Admittedly, you're using up one of the 4 Ash in the game to do so. Maybe take a picture for RK but don't save afterwards."
  - "Kidding. There's no better use for Ash than this!"
  Generic``:
  - "In the worst case scenario, any class which can wear the Mirage Vest can abuse a GBA bug."
  - "On GBA, changing weapons with a Mirage Vest equipped will refresh its start-of-battle Blink status."
  - "In the ACTUAL worst case scenario, if you bring enough Phoenix Downs, you don't really need to survive the punches."
  Staff`:
  - "All Staff users have the Sage's Staff to help mitigate Phoenix Down usage, even without actual Raise access."
  Bard:
  - "Even without any Berserk access, you can get a !Hide off before the first Tidal Wave and have a Zombie party member with a Reflect Ring eventually Reflect Shinryu's Atomic Rays for the full 55,500 HP."
  - "The only way to speed this up is to bring more than one Zombie, as there's no weapon that brings a reflectable proc and NOT access to a better method of killing."
  - "Alternatively, if you have Berserk access, use Apollo's Harp to kill really, really quickly. 8x damage is stupid."
