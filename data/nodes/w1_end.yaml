Things To Do Before You Leave World One:
  Metadata:
    next-node: galuf_castle
    previous-nodes: ['manticore']
  Generic:
    - "Before you leave W1, make sure you have the following..."
    - "Sufficient healing items to take on the Big Bridge Gilgamesh fight. There's a shop after that in Regole, and you can get infinite Tents very slowly from the Paos before the Bridge."
    - "Lix sells everything but Phoenix Downs half off, and goes away after W1."
    - "Speaking of, get a couple Phoenix Downs. You'll be really embarrassed if you have 0 and the one in the chest before Tyrannosaurus misses."
    - "The Elven Mantle from the basement of Walse, if you want it."
  Bard:
    - "Romeo's Ballad and Alluring Air. They're permanently missable! And also they're two of the most useful songs."
  INTERSECTION Berserker Freelancer:
    - "As many Death Sickles as you need from Crescent Island. They don't show up again until Fork Tower."
  Chemist:
    - "A stockpile of Turtle Shells to get you through until you can farm them again after Drakenvale."
    - "The maximum number of Dark Matter you could want in W2 is six, if you want to Death Potion everything that is vulnerable to it, and you can't farm them until W3."
  Beastmaster:
    - "You may want to catch a few more Sand Bears to plow through Bridgeamesh."
  Ninja:
    - "Enough Scrolls and Shuriken to get you to Quelb. In practice, this is a few Thunder Scrolls for most of the Big Bridge, a few non-Thunder Scrolls for Neo Garula, and a few Shuriken for Gilgamesh."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Much of what you want you can't re-get right now, but don't miss out on Level 5 Death and Aera. Possibly also Flame Thrower, Vampire, Flash, Aqua Breath, Self-Destruct, and Missile."
    - "Dark Spark and Death Claw show up again very soon, but you should have them anyway. If you didn't get Dark Spark, get it now."
    - "If you don't have a better offensive option for Melusine, you actually want to pick up some spare Flame Rods now and hold onto them until W3. This is just a time-saver, not vital."
  Beastmaster:
    - "The Blitz Whip in Jachol Cave is gone for a long time. If you want it, get it now."
  INTERSECTION Red-Mage Black-Mage:
    - "Get Toad now or wait until Phantom Village. It's not especially useful but it's your call."
  INTERSECTION White-Mage Red-Mage:
    - "Get Mini from the Catapult. It's not essential, but it's a long time before you can get it again and it's useful for weird things like Berserkers on the Crystals."
  Summoner:
    - "Get Shiva and Ramuh now or wait until literally before Twintania."
