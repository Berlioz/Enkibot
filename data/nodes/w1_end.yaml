    Generic:
    - "Before you leave W1, make sure you have the following:"
    - "Sufficient healing items to take on the Big Bridge Gilgamesh fight. There's a shop after that in Regole, and you can get infinite Tents very slowly from the Paos before the Bridge."
    - "Lix sells everything but Phoenix Downs half off, and goes away after W1."
    - "Speaking of, get a couple Phoenix Downs. You'll be really embarrassed if you have 0 and the one in the chest before Tyrannosaurus misses."
    - "The Elven Mantle from the basement of Walse, if you want it. It's permanently gone after this."
    Bard:
    - "Romeo's Ballad and Alluring Air. They're permanently missable! And also they're two of the most useful songs."
    INTERSECTION Berserker Freelancer:
    - "As many Death Sickles as you need from Crescent Island. They don't show up again until Fork Tower."
    Chemist:
    - "A stockpile of Turtle Shells to get you through until you can farm them again after Drakenvale."
    - "The maximum number of Dark Matter you could want is six, if you want to Death Potion everything that is vulnerable to it, and you can't farm them in W2."
    Beastmaster:
    - "You may want to catch a few more Sand Bears to plow through Bridgeamesh."
    Ninja:
    - "Enough Scrolls and Shuriken to get you to Quelb. In practice, this is a few Thunder Scrolls for the Big Bridge, a few non-Thunder Scrolls for Neo Garula, and a few Shuriken for Gilgamesh."
    Blue-Mage:
    - "Much of what you want you can't re-get right now, but don't miss out on Level 5 Death and Vampire. Maybe also Flash and Missile."
    Beastmaster:
    - "The Blitz Whip in Jachol Cave is gone forever after W1, even though the Cave itself exists in W3. If you want it, get it now."
