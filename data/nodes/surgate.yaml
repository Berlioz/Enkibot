  Generic:
  - "You can visit Surgate Castle at this point, but most parties shouldn't bother."
  - "If you need shop-buyable equipment, it has the next tier up above Quelb. Great Swords beyond the one in the moat, for instance."
  Bard:
  - "Bards, however, can learn the incredible Swift Song from a book in King Xezat's bedroom."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Time Mages can find the Float spell at Surgate, just in time for Exdeath."
  - "Help the librarian reshelve the books, then follow them back and ultimately open a chest for Float."
  Berserker:
  - "Surgate has the first axe with more attack power than the Death Sickle. Also, while it still has a reflectable proc, it's only Poison, so you can use it to farm Reflect Rings better than the Death Sickle."
  Samurai:
  - "You can buy a better katana here. Nothing to write home about, but more attack power."
  Dragoon:
  - "The Surgate weapon shop has Heavy Lances, for when the elemental lances you already have don't work."
  Chemist:
  - "This is also your earliest opportunity to farm Turtle Shells again in W2."
  - "The best spot is south of Moore, on a small strip of land immediately south of the mountains."
