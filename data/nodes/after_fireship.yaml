  Generic:
    - "There's a few useful things you can do with the Fire-Powered Ship before you progress the plot."
    - "After the Karnak 500, a new merchant appears walking around in the Karnak weapon/armor shop. He sells a bunch of stuff for jobs you may not have yet."
    - "The random trash encounters around Jachol are difficult, since you're not 'supposed' to be there yet."
    - "The stores in Jachol sell Mage Mashers, Coral Swords, katanas, bows, and the Ninja Suit."
  Bard:
    - "Bards can play the fourth Piano in Jachol, also. You don't have to do this right now, but do it before you leave W1."
  Geomancer:
    - "The cave near Jachol has Skull Eater encounters that give 5 ABP and drop Elixirs."
    - "They hit hard and fast, but !Gaia either oneshots them with Stalactite or (possibly) confuses them with Ignus Fatuus."
    - "For Geomancers, this is a great grind spot for ABP and Elixirs."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Red-Mage:
    - "Black and Red Mages can pick up the Toad spell in Istory. Walk in a circle on the flowers in the top-left of the town."
  Summoner:
    - "Summoners can learn Ramuh from an encounter outside Istory."
  Thief:
    - "Ramuh's common steal is a Hi-Potion and he's a 70% encounter outside Istory until you use the Ramuh item dropped from the fight."
    - "You can steal Hi-Potions forever if you keep running from the fight."
  Bard`:
    - "Bards can learn Romeo's Ballad in Istory, which Stops all enemies."
    - "In addition to being situationally useful against bosses, it's an incredible trash-clearing tool for the rest of the game."
    - "They can also play the fifth piano in Crescent, and talk to the composer NPC to learn Mighty March, which you will never use."
  Break-Rods:
    - "Rod-having parties can also pull the legendary 'Dragondarch Manuever' outside Istory, farming the tough Mini Dragons there for XP with Thunder Rods."
    - "You likely don't want to bother. Not only are raw levels not that great, it's kind of slow."
  Ninja:
    - "Despite not having rods, Ninjas can also farm the Mini Dragons outside of Istory for XP with Thunder Scrolls."
  INTERSECTION Berserker Freelancer:
    - "Swing by Crescent Island and farm up some Death Sickles from the Harvesters there."
  INTERSECTION Summoner Ninja Black-Mage Red-Mage Blue-Mage:
    - "Parties with reliable AoE magic, like !Summon or thrown scrolls, can farm the small island north of Crescent for XP and ABP."
    - "The only encounter there is 5 Black Flames, which have high evade but get oneshot by AoE magic."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Blue Mages can learn Dark Spark from those same Black Flames."
    - "It halves the target's level, which combines with L5 Death and L2 Old to murder a bunch of bosses."
    - "You can also pick up the almost-useless Self-Destruct from Bombs near Jachol."
    - "It is useful (and also funny) for one particular boss fight much later, so you should probably get it."
  Beastmaster:
    - "The cave near Jachol has a Blitz Whip in a treasure chest near the end. A nice weapon upgrade for now."
    - "If you're interested, !Control will let you farm Prototypes (they Self-Destruct) on an island west of Crescent."
    - "It's pretty good XP/ABP."
  UNION Chemist Beastmaster:
    - "...especially since you have a Chemist, who can use the guaranteed Dark Matter drops for several bosses later."
