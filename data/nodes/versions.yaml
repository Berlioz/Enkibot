Version Differences:

  Generic:
  - "There are some fairly significant differences in bugs and functionality between SNES (including the PS1 version and the Project Demi hack), GBA, and 'mobile' (iOS and Steam) versions."
  - "These tips show the applicable ones for your four jobs!"
  Black-Mage:
  - "Due to unspecified formula changes, all-target magic spells deal more damage on mobile. This makes farming (especially statues) slightly easier."
  - "As a trade-off, you can no longer all-target Thundaga on your own party and reflect 3/4 of it onto Omega to bypass its counterattacks. If this is your Omega plan, play SNES or GBA."
  White-Mage:
  - "Bridge Gilgamesh can be Silenced with Silence on SNES. This is a very small change, so likely don't let it be the tiebreaker over your personal preference."
  Thief:
  - "On mobile, Liquid Flame is in the back row, halving all attack damage. If you only have Thieves before the Fire Crystal, you likely want to avoid mobile."
  - "On mobile, you can run even faster with a Thief, stacking with the existing sprinting option."
  Monk:
  - "On mobile, !Kick works at full power from the back row. It is also no longer boosted by Kaiser Knuckles, but you weren't wearing those anyway."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Vampire is bugged on GBA to deal/restore your entire missing health, rather than half. Significantly better on GBA."
  Time-Mage:
  - "The mobile version fixes quickleaking, so you lose a free Triple Crown with it."
  - "On SNES, Meteor can hit dummy targets. This makes the final boss harder, because there are two. You want to be on GBA if Time Mage is your best offense for NED."
  Red-Mage:
  - "Bridge Gilgamesh can be Silenced with Silence on SNES. This is a very small change, so likely don't let it be the tiebreaker over your personal preference."
  Berserker:
  - "Berserkers can attack dummy targets on SNES. This makes 1-2 Berserker runs significantly better against Sandworm, Necrophobe, and NED on GBA or mobile."
  - "Berserkers always attack the default target from selecting 'Attack', typically the first one in the front row, on mobile. This makes 1-2 Berserker runs slightly better against NED on GBA."
  - "That said, Berserkers also act independently and don't start battles with empty ATB on mobile. So GBA/Mobile is largely down to preference if you don't have too many Berserkers."
  - "Once you have 3+ Berserkers, the best damage output will be on SNES - utilizing the Thornlet magic underflow glitch makes your Gaia Hammer Berserker an all-star to help make up for your lack of control."
  Beastmaster:
  - "!Calm is only bugged on GBA, so you lose an easy Triple Crown if you use SNES or mobile."
  Ranger:
  - "!Rapid Fire can attack dummy targets on SNES. This makes runs with Ranger significantly better against Necrophobe and NED (and technically Sandworm (do not !Rapid Fire the Sandworm)) on GBA or mobile."
  Bard:
  - "Songs raise numbers to a maximum of 255 on mobile, versus 99 in other verions. This doesn't matter in practice, but you can make even more hilariously large numbers."
  - "Tree-form Exdeath's physical attacks don't break !Sing on SNES or GBA, but do on mobile, so the final fight is slightly safer on mobile."
  Ninja:
  - "If you don't have a better Chicken Knife user, Dual Wielding a Twin Lance in the mainhand will disable the !Flee proc on SNES and GBA, but not mobile."
  - "If you do have a better Chicken Knife user, the Dancing Dagger's Sword Dance proc triggers a Dance from both weapons, not just one, on mobile."
  Chemist:
  - "The Death Potion !Mix is blockable on mobile, so Chemists are better on SNES or GBA."
  Samurai:
  - "!Mineuchi is only half power on mobile, but in return gains the ability to Paralyze. It doesn't bypass Chicken Knife procs on any version, so that shouldn't factor into your decision."
  - "You're trading off that damage (on an ability you'll never use) for the ability to paralyze random encounters, Titan, Carbuncle, the Gargoyles, Melusine, Catastrophe, and the Vacuum Wave part of NED."
  - "Those bosses are all heavy (or optional), so the Paralyze will be almost useless, but it is a slight point in mobile's favor."
  UNION Cannoneer Oracle Gladiator:
  - "On mobile, Omniscient is much harder to defeat without a 'proper' caster job, since Silence and Berserk don't work."
  - "Depending on your jobs, this may remove mobile as a feasible option altogether when you need to unlock an Advance job."
