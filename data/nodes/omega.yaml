  Generic:
  - "Optional superboss; there is no reason other than bragging rights (and a shiny circle on your Fiesta page) to try this."
  - "To pull this off at a sane level, you need both a way to neuter his offense and a way to actually hurt him."
  - "Without cheese but with good sandbagging classes like WHM or BLU, you can try to fight it out normally...."
  - "...but many parties don't even have a way to damage Omega through its 190 defense, 150 magic defense, Reflect, Shell, 7 elemental absorbs, 95% physical evasion, and 90% magic evasion."
  Bard:
  - "Omega is vulnerable to being stopped by Romeo's Ballad."
  - "On SNES and GBA, two hasted Bards can keep a full lock going while a third sings your speed up to 99."
  - "After maximizing speed, one Bard can keep lockdown going while the other two sing Hero's Rime and your stat buff song of choice."
  - "Then attack without fear of counterattacks."
  Beastmaster:
  - "On GBA, Omega is vulnerable to being stopped by !Calm."
  - "Three hasted Beastmasters can keep a full lock going while your fourth party member attacks without fear of counterattacks."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Time Mages can use the 'quickleak' technique (Quick+use Venom Rod+sit there with second action prompt up) to kill Omega very, very slowly."
  - "Since this takes a few real-life hours, you may not want to attempt this on an actual physical SNES/GBA/iDevice."
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists can pretty much make themselves invulnerable to every single one of Omega's attacks."
  - "That's not literally true. You can still die to two Wave Cannons in a row without getting a turn to heal in between. But only that."
  - "See, for example, sullla's solo Chemist: http://www.sullla.com/FF/omegashinryuu.html"
  - "Hint: !Mixing five Turtle Soups decreases Omega's defense and magic defense to 1."
  Pierce-Def:
  - "Piercing defense is a start - criticals and axes are okay starting ideas if there's no better plan."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Black Mages can reflect a Thundaga off allies to bypass Omega's innate Reflect."
  - "On SNES and GBA, reflecting off 3 allies and hitting the fourth (ideally someone with Diamond armor access to weaken the blow) won't trigger Omega's brutal counters."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Blue Mages can chip Omega down with Thousand Needles."
  - "This mostly sucks, but you've got Mighty Guard and White Wind to keep yourself in the fight, so it's still technically doable."
  Time-Mage`:
  - "Meteor and Comet deal unaspected damage and ignore reflects."
  - "...Unless they roll fantastically high, however, they'll get completely nullified by Omega's sky-high MDefense."
  - "Quickleaking is really it for Time Mage without other class friends."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Thundaga Sword will do 9999 damage to Omega."
  Ranger:
  - "While !Rapid Fire ignores defense and never misses, it also provokes TWO counterattacks."
  Dragoon:
  - "Dragoons can chip away with the Trident, a spear that does lightning damage."
  - "Even with !Jump, this will take ages. Consider not doing it."
  Summoner:
  - "Summoners can penetrate Omega's defenses with either Ramuh or Odin."
  - "Odin will deal superior damage unless you can Dispel the auto-shell on Omega."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can release Yellow Dragons for 9999 each."
  INTERSECTION Knight Red-Mage Gladiator: 
  - "Anyone who can use a sword can... technically damage Omega with the Coral Sword."
  - "And no, even a Gladiator doesn't want to. One less attack power than the Trident, and no !Jump to double it."
  Cannoneer:
  - "You can inflict Slow on Omega with the awesome power of your cannon."
  - "You can also halve its formidable defense."
  - "...also, Vulner Cannon doesn't provoke counterattacks."
  - "TODO: Find out if Spark/Needle Cannon provoke counterattacks, compare damage on all three."
