Byblos:
  Metadata:
    next-node: after_fireship
    previous-nodes: ['ifrit']
  Generic:
    - "3600 HP, uses a variety of debilitating spells which make prolonged engagements almost unwinnable."
    - "Also features 'fun' Drain counterattacks and self-Protect."
    - "That combination can make this fight brutal for parties with only physical damage."
  Break-Rods:
    - "Happily, you can just snap a couple of Fire Rods and call it a day."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Red-Mage:
    - "Or you can just cast Fira a few times if money is tight."
  Knight:
    - "Knights should rely on Two-Handed in this fight and any other fight where counterattacks are an issue."
  Ninja:
    - "I hope you got the Flame Scroll drop from Liquid Flame if you don't have a better strategy for doing this."
    - "You could also have farmed them in the Ship Graveyard all the way back."
    - "If you're willing to retrace that many steps, they drop from Mindflushers in the room where the World Map was."
  Berserker:
    - "Berserker-heavy teams can have trouble here, because they can trigger Byblos' counters at bad times."
    - "If you have other powerful characters or a way to cheese the fight, consider coming in with your Berserker(s) dead."
  Summoner:
    - "Summon Ifrit for some extra comedy and large damage."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "Byblos is weak to fire, so Fira !Spellblade is great."
  Geomancer:
    - "Geomancers rejoice! !Gaia here gets you Will-o-Wisp, which is Fire damage."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Time Mages with an aversion to rod abuse can still land Slow, making the fight much easier."
    - "Byblos isn't heavy, so Gravity also works if you want to spare a rod by spoiling a child."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Byblos isn't heavy or immune to paralysis, so Death Claw works to end this fight immediately."
    - "On the other hand, you might want to learn Magic Hammer here, which can be obnoxious as hell."
    - "There's at least one fight (Bridgegamesh) that's reasonable to use Magic Hammer in before you get another chance to learn it, so it's your call."
  INTERSECTION Beastmaster Freelancer:
    - "The Whip Magissa dropped all that time ago will paralyze-lock Byblos."
  Beastmaster:
    - "A released Page 32 will cast Banish for a 33% chance of killing Byblos."
