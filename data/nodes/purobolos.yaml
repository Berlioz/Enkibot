  Generic:
    - "Quick reminder: if you're on Pixel, you HAVE TO read the note on the right table in the Catapault before going to Tycoon meteorite to talk to Cid."
    - "1500 HP, 1/3 chance to cast Self-Destruct rather than fighting every third round, each casts Arise to revive the other five when killed."
    - "The easiest way to handle this is brute force with powerful AOEs to kill them all at once."
  Break-Rods:
    - "Yup, that means rods."
  NOT Break-Rods:
    - "Otherwise, whittle them down to low HP, stop, and wait for them to Self-Destruct (1/3 chance every second turn), since they don't cast Arise when they explode."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "If you don't want to just spam rods, Aqua Breath works pretty great here too."
    - "Alternatively, you can Death Claw them all and then target-all with Aera."
  Samurai:
    - "!Zeninage will get the job done, albeit at a high gil cost because there are six targets."
  Ninja:
    - "!Throwing scrolls, especially if you have a magic ability to equip, will make quick work of them."
  Summoner:
    - "They look like they're Floating, but they're not. Titan away!"
  Beastmaster:
    - "Beastmasters can just !Control each Purobolos and have them Self-Destruct targeted on themselves to avoid Arise."
  White-Mage:
    - "A Silenced Purobolos will not cast Arise upon death."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "A Silence Bladed Purobolos will not cast Arise upon death."
  Time-Mage:
    - "The Time Mage's Mute spell will NOT stop Arise from going off."
    - "Gravity will cut their HP enough to make Self-Destruct managable, however."
    - "Purobolos is also vulnerable to Slow."
  Bard:
    - "A Purobolos that's Stopped by Romeo's Ballad will not cast Arise upon death."
  Berserker:
    - "This is another fight you might want to come in with a dead/blinded Berserker for."
    - "If that's not an option, you can roll the dice on Mage Masher silence procs."
  Chemist:
    - "You can drain all their MP with Lilith's Kiss, or Berserk them, to prevent the Self-Destructs and Arises both."
  Geomancer:
    - "!Gaia fishing for Wind Slash should work just fine, unless you get unlucky."
