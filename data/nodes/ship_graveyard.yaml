  Generic:
    - "If you're feeling low on healing, the Carcruthls and Undead Husks in here both rarely drop Elixirs. Best grind spot is on the shipwreck after the Save Point, where the World Map was. It guarantees at least one Husk per encounter."
    - "Don't forget, if you need to grind for any reason, you can sleep both below decks on Faris's ship and by the save point."
  White-Mage:
    - "The enemies here are Undead, which makes this a great place to gain levels with your White Mages. Just Cure them to death."
    - "Make sure you pick up the hidden Flail, as White Mage parties will rely on it for damage for a while. It's south of where you start."
  Thief:
    - "The Daggers dropped by Skeletons here are the only way to outfit your entire Thief party; get a full set of four before fighting Siren."
  Knight:
    - "Because they sometimes factor AGI in, the Daggers dropped by Skeletons here can be better than Broadswords. Not worth the time, though."
  Ninja:
    - "If you expect to have trouble against Byblos much later, you can farm Fire Scrolls off the Mindflushers here."
