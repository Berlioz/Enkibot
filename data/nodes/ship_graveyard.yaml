  Generic:
    - "You'll probably want to use the 2 free heals the game has here to grind some of those early levels."
    - "Carcruthls can drop Elixirs, which scale very well into late game (room with 3 chests is a good spot)."
  White-Mage:
    - "The enemies here are Undead, which makes this a great place to gain levels with your White Mages."
    - "Make sure you pick up the hidden Flail; White Mage parties will rely on it for damage for a while. It's south of where you start."
  Thief:
    - "The Daggers dropped by skeleton enemies here are the only way to outfit your entire Thief party; get four before fighting Siren."
  Knight:
    - "Because they sometimes factor AGI in, the Daggers dropped by skeleton enemies here can be better than Broadswords. Probably not worth the time, though."
  Ninja:
    - "If you expect to have trouble against Byblos much later, you can farm Fire Scrolls off the Mindflushers here."
