  Generic:
    - "On the walk down, dodge the desert unless you want to fight the powerful Dhorme Chimera."
    - "You can heal for free in the Library by drinking from the pot on the left side of the second floor."
    - "Inside the library, remember that Page 32 can and will use Level 5 Death on any party members with a level divisible by 5."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Blue Mages: you'll obviously have to grind to 15 or 20 to learn Level 5 Death for yourself, but make sure your whole party is not at that level for obvious reasons."
    - "You can also learn Moon Flute in here from Page 256, but all it does is Berserk your party. Yes, even when you cast it rather than the enemy."
    - "Page 32 casts Aera, if you missed it from Gigas in the Karnak 500."
    - "You could learn Aqua Breath from the Dhorme Chimera in the desert outside, but you'll have some time to level more before you need it for the Sandworm. Your call."
  Chemist:
    - "The turtles infesting the grasslands around here drop Turtle Shells; you're gonna want to farm 99 of them for your Chemist."
    - "I know it sucks, but Drain Kiss is really really really good and you can basically run from everything else for the rest of the game."
  Thief:
    - "Page 256es are carrying a Ninja Suit as a steal, a pretty respectable piece of cloth armor."
    - "That said, you'll be able to just buy them not too long from now."
  Geomancer:
    - "Geomancers will often get fire-elemental Ignus Fatuus from !Gaia here, so they're actually good."
  UNION Blue-Mage Beastmaster:
    - "!Control will also let you learn (the marginally useful) Off-Guard from the Page 256."
    - "The same for (the useless) Transfusion from Mythril Dragons in the forest outside."
