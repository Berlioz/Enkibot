  Metadata:
    next-node: karnak_500
    previous-nodes: ['fireship']
  Generic:
    - "3000 HP, transitions randomly between three forms when struck."
    - "The Human Form has single and multi target attacks and counters with Blaze."
    - "The Hand Form has single target attacks that can paralyze and counters with Fira. It runs out of MP after three casts. Absorbs fire, nullifies ALL other elements including ice."
    - "The Tornado Form casts Fira on itself to heal. It runs out of MP after five casts."
  UNION Ranger Freelancer:
    - "Killing Liquid Flame in Tornado Form makes it drop a Fire Bow, useful in the next dungon and not buyable until later."
  UNION White-Mage Red-Mage:
    - "Liquid Flame can be confused, leading it to do nothing except attack itself. Useful for choosing which drop you get!"
  Break-Rods:
    - "Frost Rods will kill in two snaps. Don't use them when it's in hand form!"
  Time-Mage:
    - "Casting Demi works on the human and tornado forms."
    - "One cast of Demi followed up by a Frost Rod snap (again, only on the human and tornado forms) should kill."
  Monk:
    - "Fewer, bigger hits do better against counter-heavy enemies, so !Focus is good here."
  Knight:
    - "Fewer, bigger hits do better against counter-heavy enemies, so Two-Handed is good here."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "Blizzara Sword will inflict massive damage. Make sure you have a way to damage Hand Form to turn it back to a Form weak to ice."
    - "You can unequip your weapon and re-equip it through the Item menu to remove your !Spellblade effect without using your turn."
  Generic`:
    - "Since the forms' MP are tracked separately and Tornado Form doesn't attack you, consider just sitting there until it runs out of MP."
  Berserker:
    - "Consider going into the fight with your Berserker dead to control phase changes, at least until you run Tornado out of MP so it can't heal."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "All three forms absorb wind, so don't use Aero. Just break rods."
