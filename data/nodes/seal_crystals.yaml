  Generic:
  - "For grinding XP, encounters in the woods outside will give you either 800 XP or a chance at Elixir drops."
  - "7777 HP each, not Heavy, 20% magic evasion and level 77 to make it difficult to hit with inaccurate spells."
  - "Each Crystal switches from attacking to casting a spell at 3000 HP remaining."
  - "The top one casts Firaga, the left Aeroga, the bottom Earth Shaker, and the right Aqua Breath."
  - "Each Crystal also absorbs attacks of its element, and all four nullify Ice/Lightning/Holy/Poison."
  - "In general, avoid all-target attacks unless you think you can end the fight in one cycle."
  - "Parties with reasonable offenses can simply get a Crystal close to 3000 HP and try to kill it quickly."
  - "If you can (and aren't on mobile), put Bone Mail on Galuf to save yourself some time in the next fight."
  - "If you equip the Flame Shield found in the previous area, the top crystal will now heal you with Fire 3."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Death Claw, when it gets through their magic evasion, takes a Crystal down to single-digit HP."
  - "While the Crystals can be blinded, that's probably not the best use of your time."
  Berserker:
  - "Death Sickle procs will work, though watch out for dealing too much damage if you don't get procs early."
  - "Consider using the Mini Magicians outside to Mini your Berserker, which reduces their damage but doesn't stop the Death proc."
  White-Mage:
  - "Shell means you have a lot less to worry about from the spellcasting phase."
  Samurai:
  - "The Crystals have 10 defense, but that's not enough to protect them from !Zeninage."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "The Crystals are NOT vulnerable to Break. Sorry, you don't have Death !Spellblade yet."
  Chemist:
  - "Death Potion works on the Crystals. This is why you probably farmed Prototypes in World 1."
  Bard:
  - "Swift Song will eventually make a noticeable difference in a damage race against a spellcasting Crystal."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Sandcrawlers from the desert outside Moogle Village !Release to cast Maelstrom, which has a 40.8% chance of putting each Crystal down to single-digit HP."
  - "Obviously, don't release one until you're prepared to follow up with pokes to finish the vulnerable Crystals off."
  Time-Mage:
  - "While the Crystals are high level and have some amount of Magic Evade, they ARE vulnerable to Gravity spells."
  - "Gravity deals low enough damage to not knock the Crystal into spellcasting phase, so the correct order is Gravity -> Graviga -> Comet."
  - "You can spend 'extra' turns trying to land the initial Gravity on the other Crystals while you wait for Graviga to hit, as long as you're always prepared to Comet immediately afterwards."
  - "The Crystals are also vulnerable to Slow, to make this tactic even safer."
  INTERSECTION Ranger Freelancer:
  - "High level and magic evasion doesn't do anything to stop Killer Bow procs."
  - "Don't bother blinding the Crystals with a Dark Bow, that's wasted turns that could have been Killer Bow attacks."
  - "If you find you're pushing the Crystals into casting range fishing for Killer Bow procs, let a Mini Magician outside make you Mini first."
  Generic`:
  - "If you did put Bone Mail on Galuf, and you're not on mobile, have him use a Phoenix Down on himself against Exdeath."
  Blue-Mage`:
  - "If you're not on mobile, Self-Destruct also ends the fight instantly."
