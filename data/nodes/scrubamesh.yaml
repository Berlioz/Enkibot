  Generic:
  - "13000 effective HP, spams the same old Blue Magic + new status aliments."
  - "Totally optional, if you don't need the Genji Helmet and, later, the Genji Armor."
  - "He won't show up in the Void or to help you fight Necrophobe if you skip this, though."
  - "This fight's not difficult enough to bother doing anything fancy. Just attack him and heal if needed."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can go downstairs and !Catch a Yellow Dragon, which will carve off 9999 HP thanks to Gilgamesh's inflated true HP total."
  Dragoon:
  - "Don't forget the Partisan in a chest to the right of the Gilgamesh room. It's the highest-power spear you can get at this point, and also not elemental."
  Ninja:
  - "Don't forget the free Fuma Shuriken in a chest to the right of the Gilgamesh room."
