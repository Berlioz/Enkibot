  Generic:
    - "Here are some general tips for your jobs!"
  Knight:
    - "The Knight is straightforward, but the combo of !Guard + Cover is amazing."
    - "If the party is in critical HP, you ignore all single-target physical attacks."
    - "This is especially brutal with a way to inflict Berserk. White Mages can do so easily with a spell, but all staff and rod users can later on."
    - "Chemists can also Berserk, though if you have Chemist you don't need !Guard to win."
    - "Bear in mind that even if you have Two-Handed equipped, you CAN equip a Shield mid-combat through the item menu."
    - "This will take away your Two-Handed damage bonus until you unequip the shield, but can be useful with elemental absorption shields."
  Monk:
    - "Monks do amazing damage at first, but rapidly taper off after World 1."
    - "Barehanded attacks can get critical hits, allowing you to penetrate high physical defense."
    - "'HP +X%' abilities can allow your squishier classes to survive the final boss's Almagest."
    - "The Deep Sea Trench has Kaiser Knuckles to boost your monk's damage output... but they still don't do enough to give up Hermes Sandals."
    - "Most parties will just use their Monk as a beefy item user or spellcaster later in the game."
  Thief:
    - "Thieves have access to some very good items earlier than usual. This guide will note particuarly juicy steals."
    - "Unfortunately, bad stats and garbage gear options probably make Thief the worst of the Wind jobs overall."
    - "The capstone Thief ability, Artful Dodger, grants +16 agility, which is actually a lot."
    - "Lastly, remember that the Thief's !Mug ability is a safe way to use the Chicken Knife, even if it's 'just' a basic attack."
  Black-Mage:
    - "Black Mage is great. Just blow up everything in the game with your obscene damage output."
    - "Remember that equipped Rods increase the power of matching elemental spells by 50%. Your currently equipped weapon can be changed mid-battle from the Item Menu."
    - "If your whole party is Reflected, you can bounce a groupcast spell off them for double damage."
  White-Mage:
    - "White Mage is pretty broken."
    - "Protect, Shell, and Blink let you to go toe-to-toe with almost anything."
    - "Many bosses are vulnerable to the Confuse, Silence, and Berserk status ailments."
    - "Casting Mini on the party raises their evasion into the stratosphere, especially if they have a shield, and doesn't affect magical damage output."
    - "Once you have it, Holy is a fantastic single target damage option, easily on par with other powerful classes."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Blue Mage is completely broken."
    - "Dark Spark + L5 Death lets you two-shot about half the bosses in the game."
    - "White Wind is the best healing spell in the game, and even works on Bone Mail wearers."
    - "L2 Old isn't as impressive as L5 Death, but trivializes several otherwise difficult fights and can combo with L5 Death."
    - "Mighty Guard is basically farewell to being worried about straight damage, forever."
    - "With the wind-boosting Air Knife, the Aero/ra/ga line of spells is solid damage."
    - "Vampire is bugged to do damage equal to your missing HP and heal that much on GBA, but only half that on SNES and mobile."
  Berserker:
    - "All jokes aside, the first Berserker is a surprisingly solid class. It's when you're stuck with multiples that the trouble starts."
    - "They hit super hard, get plate armor, axe attacks divide the target's physical defense by 4, and they can also equip daggers if axe/hammer accuracy is a concern."
    - "Special shoutout to the Death Sickle you can farm in World 1. It can cast Death when it hits, and even a lot of bosses die to that proc."
    - "Berserkers with any magic command equipped are brutal with a Rune Axe."
    - "On the SNES version only, a Berserker (3 magic) with a Thornlet (-5 magic) underflows to 253 magic. The Gaia Hammer, which casts Quake when attacking, deals stupid amounts of damage with that."
    - "If you've got a 3+ Berserker run, you should definitely play on SNES, even if Sandworm is significantly harder."
    - "If you have 4 Berserkers, I'm sorry (or you picked the secret command.)  Play on SNES, grind to 18+ for Liquid Flame and 40+ for Sandworm, Thief's Knife some extra Thornlets for your extra Gaia Hammers. And good luck."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "Mystic Knight is completely broken."
    - "Status effect spellblades have a 100% chance to land for all non-immune enemies."
    - "Several bosses have very high magic evade, making normal status ailment applications very unlikely. You completely ignore that."
    - "Elemental -aga Spellblades instantly kill anything with a weakness to it, or 'just' do 4x damage and ignore defense to Heavy targets with a weakness (like many bosses.)"
    - "Use Drain or status swords in random encounters. Elemental swords do nothing against enemies neutral to that element."
    - "If you need to quickly disenchant a sword, just un/re-equip it from the item menu mid-combat."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Time Mages may not be able to heal, but they can use the Healing Staff from Tycoon."
    - "They can also break rods if they need magic damage before they get Comet."
    - "The Slow spell is available early and works on nearly everything."
    - "Comet and Meteor do damage independent of your stats/gear (other than level) and bypass Reflect."
    - "Time-based effects like Regen continue during Quick, making Regen a full heal if you have the patience."
    - "You can kill literally anything in the game (very slowly) by casting Quick, snapping a Poison Rod with your first action, and waiting hours without taking your second action."
  Summoner:
    - "Summoner is pretty broken."
    - "They have incredible damage output, but generally only have one 'good' element at a time."
    - "Remember that you can always snap an elemental rod for higher-power fire/lightning/ice damage."
    - "Don't bother deliberately skipping optional summons to boost !Call. It's still trash even if you only get Ifrit, Titan, and Syldra."
    - "Air Knife boosted Syldras are your best offensive option through the endgame. Which means that the side quests to get Bahamut and Leviathan are pointless."
    - "Don't underestimate Golem - he can singlehandedly neuter physical-heavy bosses."
    - "...or anyone you can land Berserk on, which Summoners can (once per fight) with the Wonder Wand."
  Red-Mage:
    - "Sorry, Red Mage kind of blows, unless you have another mage and the patience to grind ABP for !Dualcast."
    - "By itself, Red Mage's only good offense is rod snapping. Stock up."
    - "Yes, they can equip swords. Yes, also they have absolutely no strength and even less survivability."
    - "More importantly, they can equip staves, granting early access to Cura (Healing Staff) and any access at all to Berserk (Power Staff) and Dispel (Judgment Staff)."
    - "There's a surprising amount of utility in low-level White Magic, especially with !Dualcast."
    - "Being able to cast Protect or Raise twice in one action is surprisingly good."
    - "You can also stick Confuse/Silence/Sleep onto enemies much more reliably."
    - "Even with that, if the rest of your party is strong, grinding out !Dualcast likely takes too long to bother."
  Beastmaster:
    - "Beastmaster is completely broken, but it takes significant amounts of effort."
    - "!Releasing the correct monster can trivialize any boss fight."
    - "Each individual boss entry has a suggested !Release noted. For more details, check http://tinyurl.com/catchspreadsheet"
    - "Remember that Beastmasters aren't the worst physically, and Whips can attack from the back row."
    - "!Calm also works on a surprisingly large amount of things [on GBA, where it's bugged to do so], and can be used to stunlock several annoying bosses."
  Geomancer:
    - "!Gaia is tricky to work with, but can pull out powerful effects sometimes."
    - "Many of the stronger !Gaia effects are Wind-based, so Air Knives make Geomancer much better."
    - "Bells are weird. Don't be fooled by their attack stat - 2 of the 4 Bells use Magic and Agility, while the other 2 have Strength-based Rune-Axe-like formulas. They're likely better than they look, but also worse."
    - "The Mobile version changed !Gaia to always roll the full 1-100 results table independent of level, which can be both good and bad."
  Ninja:
    - "Ninja's Dual Wield passive is as good as in any game, especially on other classes."
    - "Having the Twin Lance in the main hand bypasses the Chicken Knife's !Flee proc on SNES and GBA."
    - "But the secret power ability is often !Throw. Scrolls have a higher base power than level 3 magic!"
    - "Giving a Ninja a magic ability like !Summon or !White to boost their magic stat makes scrolls completely obscene."
    - "Having an elemental rod equipped also boosts the elemental scrolls by 50%, just like regular spells."
    - "You can bury everything in the game, including the final boss, in a hail of anime wallscrolls."
  Bard:
    - "Bard is secretly one of the best classes in the game."
    - "Equip Harps transfers great agility and magic stats, which is nice for things like Rune Axe Berserkers and !Throwing Ninjas."
    - "Romeo's Ballad and Alluring Air are fantastically effective against random encounters."
    - "Stat-boosting songs, especially Swift Song, allow you to steamroll any boss you can stay alive against."
    - "Even the final boss melts against a level 99 party with 99 strength, magic, and speed."
  Ranger:
    - "Ranger is pretty broken, but not until you pony up 605 AP."
    - "The Ranger's signature ability is !Rapid Fire, which hits 4 times for half damage."
    - "...it also never misses, procs !Spellblade, ignores defense (!) and doesn't proc the Chicken Knife (!!)."
    - "This rarely comes up in a Fiesta run, but savor the combination of Rapid Fire+Spellblade on a Freelancer if you get it."
    - "If you're between level 10 and 19, !Animals often gives Nightingale, a powerful partywide heal effect."
  Samurai:
    - "The Samurai is basically a big beefcake with a few dirty tricks available at need."
    - "Katanas can get critical hits, which ignore physical defense."
    - "!Zeninage is expensive, since it literally tosses gil, but it's amazing all-target damage on low-defense enemies."
    - "!Iainuki is an 85% chance of instant death to all enemies. A surprising number of bosses are not Heavy, and therefore vulnerable to this."
    - "!Mineuchi is broken on SNES and GBA to just be !Attack with a different name. On mobile, it does 50% less damage but inflicts Paralyze."
  Dragoon:
    - "The Dragoon is a vanilla beefcake with almost no dirty tricks available."
    - "!Lance is a last-resort method for mages to restore their own MP mid-fight. It's straight up unusable running off a Dragoon's innate magic score."
    - "Remember that !Jump does full damage when used from the back row, and double damage with spears."
    - "Careful timing and knowledge of boss patterns can allows you to dodge nasty attacks."
  Dancer:
    - "Dancers are an extremely squishy front-row class heavily dependent on luck. But when !Dance rolls Sword Dance, they murder things."
    - "Certain pieces of gear (Rainbow Dress. Ignore Lamia's Tiara once you have a Dress and Red Slippers always.) boost the rate of Sword Dances, amping Dancer's lategame offense."
    - "Sword Dance is also a safe way to wield the Chicken Knife."
    - "The real benefit of Dancer is the ability to learn Equip Ribbon. Being able to ignore almost all status effects is exactly as dumb as it sounds."
  UNION Dancer Monk:
    - "Barehanded is compatible with Sword Dance, and it can crit just like any other fist attack."
  Chemist:
    - "Chemist can carry any party. It's obscene. It makes Blue Mage look bad."
    - "!Drink allows them to haste themselves and double their HP, making survivability easy."
    - "But the real power of the class lies in !Mix."
    - "Their staple damage option is Succubus Kiss (Turtle Shell + Maiden's Kiss), which is a 255 magic power version of Drain."
    - "That's stronger than Meteor, Holy, and Flare, available halfway through World 1, and heals the user to boot."
    - "Various easy !Mixes can also cast Haste, Protect, Shell, heal to full, revive with full health, and refill MP."
    - "!Mix can also give elemental/status immunities and inflict aliments with 100% accuracy."
  Freelancer:
    - "Despite its lack of abilities, the equipment options available to a Freelancer make it more powerful than a fair number of 'normal' classes."
    - "By endgame, a Freelancer can attack or use a weapon to inflict Blind, Paralyze, Old, Sleep, Berserk, Poison, Confuse, and Death."
    - "...and also cast Firaga, Blizzaga, Thundaga, Bio, Dispel, Raise, Protect, Return, and Haste. For free."
    - "That's not even getting into their ability to wear a Ribbon, the Aegis Shield, and the Bone Mail simultaneously."
    - "They also gain the best stats from the other jobs in your party once those jobs are mastered, along with two ability slots instead of one."
  Mime:
    - "A special class obtained only in World 3 in Sunken Walse Tower."
    - "They have !Mimic instead of !Fight, and three free slots for abilities in addition to that (which includes !Fight and !Item)."
    - "Their equipment access is middling, though they do keep the best stats and innate passives of mastered classes, just like Freelancer."
    - "!Mimic is an interesting ability, though timing it to do what you want can be tricky with cast times being different."
    - "!Mimicing !Zeninage still consumes money, but everything else, including items and spells, are used at no cost."
    - "You also still get random effects from things like !Dance or !Animals - you're copying the command, not the result."
    - "!Mimicing a rod snap (or other weapon use from the Items menu) uses the weapon in the Mime's hand as an item. This won't make a rod snap unless the Mime already has a rod equipped."
  Gladiator:
    - "A forbidden class you can normally only get in GBA and mobile after getting all four tablets."
    - "Strong, beefy, and can use almost any physical weapon and shields."
    - "!Bladeblitz physically attacks all enemies at 75% power. Good for random encounters and the occasional boss (like Necrophobe's Barriers)."
    - "!Finisher can either do nothing, inflict a critical hit, or deal 9999 damage of the crystal element of the character using it."
    - "That's Wind for Bartz, Water for Lenna, Earth for Galuf and Krile, and Fire for Faris."
    - "!Finisher's odds of doing stronger hits goes up with the job mastery level, peaking at 50% 9999, 25% critical hit, 25% miss."
    - "Long Reach is a passive that lets you deal full damage attacking from the back row with any weapon. Fine, but rarely worth the slot."
    - "Lure is a passive that increases encounter rate. Pretty useless, unless you really need to grind."
  Oracle:
    - "A forbidden class you can normally only get in GBA and mobile after getting all four tablets."
    - "Has a higher magic stat than even Summoner, but can only use Staves, and its !Predict ability is difficult at best to use."
    - "!Condemn works on any target that's not Heavy, totally ignoring status immunity. Just Doom anything it works on, or Rejuvenate yourself."
    - "Its wait time goes down with a higher Oracle mastery level."
    - "!Predict has effects determined by the last digit of the user's MP at a power determined by the last digit of its target's HP."
    - "Several !Predicts can hit your own party. This can be beneficial or deadly depending on your equipment."
    - "Cleansing, which triggers at last digit of MP=0, only hits enemies and does non-elemental damage. It's reliable."
    - "Blessing, which triggers at last digit of MP=7, only hits the party and heals and Regens. It's also reliable."
    - "Second Rank Cleansing (3 MP) and Third Rank Blessing (7 MP) combo into each other infinitely if you don't want to think about it."
    - "Also note that !Predict bypasses enemy React scripts, so they never counter. This includes annoying pests like Omega. Be careful not to kill Tree Exdeath this way, you'll skip NED."
    - "Read Ahead is a passive that lowers the encounter rate. It's a solid time-saver that's totally useless for bosses. Kind of like Oracle."
  Cannoneer:
    - "A forbidden class you can normally only get in GBA and mobile once after getting all four tablets."
    - "Average stats and equipment access (notably, you do get the Aegis Shield), but amazing abilities."
    - "!Open Fire is ridiculous early on, doing good damage and also randomly inflicting one of Poison/Blind/Confuse/Death. Fiesta Mod Cannoneers have it super easy."
    - "!Combine can only be used once you've actually unlocked Cannoneer, as the materials used for it are only sold in special shops that don't appear until then."
    - "Blitzshot+Dark Matter makes Chaos Cannon, which inflicts Death."
    - "Blitzshot+Iron Draft makes Vulner Cannon, which halves physical and magical defense and also doesn't trigger counterattacks."
    - "Blitzshot+Gold Needle makes Needle Cannon, which deals a flat 3000 damage. Useful for very high-defense targets."
    - "You can also set Berserk (with Power Drink), Blind (with Ash), Old (with Speed Shake), Slow (with Turtle Shell), and even Poison (with Blastshot+Dark Matter)."
