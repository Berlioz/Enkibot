  Generic:
    - "Here are some basic general tips based on your jobs!"
  Knight:
    - "The Knight seems straightforward, but the combo of !Guard + Cover is amazing."
    - "If the party is in critical HP, you ignore all single-target physical attacks."
    - "This is especially brutal with a way to inflict Berserk."
    - "(White Mages can do so easily with a spell; staff and rod-users can later on)."
    - "So can Chemists, though if you have Chemist you don't need !Guard to win."
    - "Bear in mind that even if you have Two-Handed equipped, you CAN equip a Shield mid-combat through the item menu."
    - "This will take away your Two-Handed damage bonus until you unequip the shield, but can be useful with elemental absorption shields."
  Monk:
    - "Monks do amazing damage at first, but rapidly taper off after World 1."
    - "Barehanded attacks can crit, allowing you to penetrate high physical defense."
    - "'HP +X%' abilities can allow your squishier classes to survive the final boss's Almagest."
    - "The Deep Sea Trench has Kaiser Knuckles to boost your monk's damage output... but still not by enough to give up Hermes Sandals."
    - "Most parties will just use their monk as a beefy item user or spellcaster later in the game."
  Thief:
    - "Thieves have access to some very good stuff early on."
    - "Unfortunately, bad stats and garbage gear options probably make Thief the worst of the Wind jobs overall."
    - "I'll note particuarily juicy steals as the walkthrough goes on."
    - "The capstone Thief ability, Artful Dodger, grants +16 agility, which is actually a lot."
    - "Lastly, remember that the Thief's !Mug ability is a safe way to use the Chicken Knife."
  Black-Mage:
    - "Black Mage is pretty broken. Just blow up everything in the game with your obscene damage output."
    - "Black Mages should remember that equipped Rods increase the power of matching elemental spells by 50%."
    - "Your currently equipped weapon can be changed mid-battle from the Item Menu."
    - "Flare kind of sucks. It's not worth doing Fork Tower for on its own."
    - "If your whole party is Reflected, you can bounce a groupcast spell off them for double damage."
  White-Mage:
    - "White Mage is pretty broken."
    - "The White Mage's Protect and Shell allow you to go toe-to-toe with almost anything."
    - "Many bosses are vulnerable to the Confuse, Silence, and Berserk status ailments."
    - "Berserk is especially effective when combined with Blink to protect your party."
    - "Casting Mini on the party raises their evasion into the stratosphere, especially if they have a shield."
    - "Once you have it, Holy is a fantastic single target damage option, on par with other power classes."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Blue Mage is completely broken."
    - "Dark Spark + L5 Death lets you two-shot about half the bosses in the game."
    - "Goblin Punch also does 8x damage to enemies of the same level, which may be abusable."
    - "Note that Vampire is bugged to do full damage and equal healing in GBA, but only heals half that in SNES and mobile versions."
    - "White Wind is the best healing spell in the game, and even works on Bone Mail wearers."
    - "L2 Old isn't as impressive as L5 Death, but trivializes several otherwise difficult fights and can combo with L5 Death."
    - "Mighty Guard is basically farewell to being worried about straight damage, forever."
    - "With the wind-boosting Air Knife, the Aero/ra/ga line of spells is solid damage."
  Berserker:
    - "Berserker is, all joking aside, a surprisingly solid class."
    - "It's when you're assigned multiples that you start having trouble."
    - "They hit super hard, get plate armor, and can equip daggers if accuracy is a concern."
    - "Special shoutout to the Death Sickle you can farm in World 1. It can cast Death when it hits, and you can scam instant kills on a lot of bosses with it."
    - "Berserkers with a magic command equipped are brutal with a Rune Axe."
    - "On the SNES version only, a Berserker (3 magic) with a Thornlet (-5 magic) underflows to 253 magic. The Gaia Hammer, which casts Quake when attacking, deals stupid amounts of damage with that."
    - "If you've got a 3+ berserker run, I strongly encourage you to start on SNES."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "Mystic Knight is completely broken."
    - "Status effect spellblades have a 100% chance to land for all non-immune enemies."
    - "Several bosses have status effect 'immunity' via high magic evade; you completely ignore that."
    - "-aga Spellblades instantly kill anything with a weakness to it, or do 9999 to Heavy targets."
    - "Use Drain or status swords in random encounters; elemental swords do nothing vs. neutral."
    - "If you need to quickly disenchant a sword, just un/re-equip it from the item menu mid-combat."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Time Mage is on the precipice of completely broken."
    - "Time Mages may not be able to heal, but they can use the Healing Staff from Tycoon."
    - "They can also break rods if they need magic damage before they get Comet."
    - "The Slow spell is available early and works on, like, everything."
    - "Comet and Meteor do damage independent of your stats/gear and cannot be reflected."
    - "Time-based effects like Regen continue during Quick, making Regen a full heal if you have the patience.
    - "You can kill literally anything in the game (very slowly) by casting Quick, snapping a Poison Rod with your first action, and waiting hours without taking your second action."
  Summoner:
    - "Summoner is pretty broken."
    - "They have incredible damage output, but generally only have one 'good' element at a time."
    - "Remember that you can always snap an elemental rod for higher-power fire/lightning/ice damage."
    - "Don't bother deliberately skipping optional summons to boost !Call; it's trash regardless."
    - "Air Knife boosted Syldras are your best offensive option through the endgame."
    - "This makes the side quests to get Bahamut and Leviathan basically pointless."
    - "Don't underestimate Golem - he can singlehandedly neuter physical-heavy bosses."
    - "...or anyone you can land Berserk on, which Summoners can (once per fight) with the Wonder Wand."
  Red-Mage:
    - "Sorry, Red Mage kind of blows, unless you have another mage and the patience for Dualcast."
    - "By itself, Red Mage's only good offense is rod snapping. Stock up."
    - "Yes, they can equip swords. Yes, they have absolutely no strength and even less survivability."
    - "More importantly, they can equip staves, granting early access to Cura (Healing Staff) and any access at all to Berserk (Power Staff) and Dispel (Judgment Staff)."
    - "There's a surprising amount of utility in low-level White Magic, especially with Dualcast."
    - "Being able to Protect or Raise twice in one action is surprisingly good."
    - "You can also stick Confuse/Silence/Sleep onto enemies much more reliably."
    - "If the rest of your party is strong, I wouldn't advise grinding out Dualcast, though."
  Beastmaster:
    - "Beastmaster is completely broken, but it takes significant amounts of effort."
    - "!Releasing the correct monster will trivialize any boss fight."
    - "Each individual boss entry has a suggested !Release noted. For more details, check http://tinyurl.com/catchspreadsheet"
    - "Remember that Beastmasters aren't the worst physically, and Whips can attack from the back row."
    - "!Calm also works on a surprisingly large amount of things [on GBA, where it's bugged to do so], and can be used to stunlock several annoying bosses."
  Geomancer:
    - "!Gaia is tricky to work around, but can pull out powerful effects sometimes."
    - "Many of the stronger !Gaia effects are Wind-based, so Air Knives make Geomancer much better."
    - "Bells are weird; don't be fooled by their attack stat. 2 of the 4 of them work like Rune weapons, except using Agility instead of Strength, and Geomancer has good Magic as well."
    - "The Mobile version changed !Gaia to always roll the full 1-100 results table independent of level, which can be both good and bad."
  Ninja:
    - "The Ninja's Dual Wield is as good as ever, especially on other classes."
    - "Having the Twin Lance in the main hand ignores the Chicken Knife's Flee chance on SNES and GBA."
    - "But the real power ability is often !Throw. The scrolls have a higher base power than level 3 magic!"
    - "Giving a Ninja a magic ability like !Summon or !White to boost their magic stat makes scrolls completely obscene."
    - "Having an elemental rod equipped boosts the elemental scrolls by 50%, just like regular spells."
    - "You can bury everything in the game, including the final boss, in a hail of anime wallscrolls."
  Bard:
    - "Bard is secretly one of the best classes in the game."
    - "Equip Harps transfers great agility and magic, which is nice for Rune Axe Berserkers, Throwing Ninjas, etc."
    - "Romeo's Ballad and Alluring Air are fantastically effective against random encounters."
    - "The stat-boosting songs allow you to steamroll any boss you can stay alive against."
    - "The final boss ain't got nothing on a level 99 party with 99 strength, magic, and speed."
  Ranger:
    - "Ranger is pretty broken, but not until you pony up 605 AP."
    - "The Ranger's signature ability is !Rapid Fire, which hits 4 times for half damage."
    - "...it also never misses, procs !Spellblade, ignores defense (!) and doesn't proc the Chicken Knife (!!)."
    - "This rarely comes up in a Fiesta run, but savor the combination of Rapid Fire+Spellblade on a Freelancer if you get it."
    - "If you're between level 10 and 19, you'll often get Nightingale, a powerful heal-all effect, from !Animals."
  Samurai:
    - "The Samurai is basically a big beefcake with a few dirty tricks available at need."
    - "Katanas can crit, ignoring physical defense."
    - "!Zeninage is expensive, since it literally tosses gil, but it's amazing all-target damage on low-defense enemies."
    - "!Iainuki is an 85% chance of instant death to all enemies. A surprising number of bosses are not Heavy, and therefore vulnerable to this."
  Dragoon:
    - "The Dragoon is a beefcake with almost no dirty tricks available. Vanilla but decent."
    - "!Lance is a last-resort method for mages to restore their own MP mid-fight."
    - "It's straight up unusable running off a Dragoon's innate magic score, though."
    - "Remember that !Jump does full damage when used from the back row."
    - "Careful timing and knowledge of boss patterns also allows you to dodge nasty attacks."
  Dancer:
    - "Dancers are an extremely squishy front-row class which is way too luck-dependent. But when !Dance rolls Sword Dance, they're amazing."
    - "Certain pieces of gear (Rainbow Dress. Ignore Lamia's Tiara and Red Slippers.) boost the rate of Sword Dances, amping Dancer's lategame offense."
    - "Sword Dance is also a safe way to wield the Chicken Knife."
    - "The real benefit of rolling Dancer is the ability to learn Equip Ribbon. Being able to ignore almost all status effects is exactly as dumb as it sounds."
  UNION Dancer Monk:
    - "Barehanded is compatible with Sword Dance, and it can crit just like any other fist attack."
  Chemist:
    - "Chemist can carry any party. It's obscene. It makes Blue Mage look bad."
    - "!Drink allows them to haste themselves and double their HP, making survivability easy."
    - "But the real power of the class lies in !Mix."
    - "Their staple is Succubus Kiss (Turtle Shell + Maiden's Kiss), which is a 255 magic power version of Drain."
    - "That's stronger than Meteor, Holy, and Flare, available halfway through World 1, and heals the user to boot."
    - "Turtle Shell mixes can also Haste, Protect, Shell, heal, revive with full health, and refill MP."
    - "!Mix can also give elemental/status immunities and inflict aliments with 100% accuracy."
  Freelancer:
    - "Despite its lack of abilities, the equipment options available to a Freelancer make it more powerful than a fair number of 'normal' classes."
    - "By endgame, a Freelancer can attack or use a weapon to inflict Blind, Paralyze, Old, Sleep, Berserk, Poison, Confuse, and instant death."
    - "...and also cast Firaga, Blizzaga, Thundaga, Bio, Dispel, Raise, Protect, Return, and Haste. For free."
    - "That's not even getting into their ability to wear a Ribbon, the Aegis Shield, and the Bone Mail simultaneously."
    - "They also gain the best stats from the other jobs in your party once those jobs are mastered, along with two ability slots instead of one."
  Mime:
    - "A special class obtained only in World 3 in Sunken Walse Tower."
    - "They have !Mimic instead of !Fight, and three free slots for abilities in addition to that (that includes !Fight and !Item)."
    - "Their equipment access is middling, though they do keep the best stats of mastered classes and innate passives, just like Freelancer."
    - "!Mimic is an interesting ability, though timing it to do what you want can be tricky with cast times being different."
    - "!Mimicing !Zeninage will still consume money, but everything else, including items and spells, are used at no cost."
    - "You also still get random effects from things like !Dance or !Animals - you're copying the command, not the result."
    - "Sadly, some things don't work well. !Mimicing a rod snap uses the weapon in the Mime's hand."
  Gladiator:
    - "A forbidden class you can normally only get in GBA and mobile after getting all four tablets."
    - "Strong, beefy, and can use almost any physical weapon."
    - "!Bladeblitz physically attacks all enemies at 75% power. Good for random encounters and the occasional boss (like Necrophobe's Barriers)."
    - "!Finisher can either do nothing, inflict a critical hit, or deal 9999 damage of the crystal element of the character using it."
    - "That's Wind for Bartz, Water for Lenna, Earth for Galuf/Krile, and Fire for Faris."
    - "!Finisher's odds of doing stronger hits goes up with the job mastery level, peaking at 50% 9999, 25% critical hit, 25% miss."
    - "Long Reach is a passive that lets you deal full damage attacking from the back row with any weapon. Fine, but rarely worth the slot."
    - "Lure is a passive that increases encounter rate. Pretty useless, unless you really need to grind."
  Oracle:
    - "A forbidden class you can normally only get in GBA and mobile after getting all four tablets."
    - "Has a higher magic stat than even Summoner, but can only use Staves, and its !Predict ability is difficult at best to use."
    - "!Condemn works on any target that's not Heavy, totally ignoring status immunity. Just Doom anything it works on, or Rejuvenate yourself."
    - "The command's wait time goes down the higher the job mastery level of the character."
    - "!Predict has effects determined by the last digit of the user's MP at a power determined by the last digit of its target's HP."
    - "Several !Predicts can hit your own party. This can be beneficial or deadly depending on your equipment."
    - "Cleansing, which triggers at last digit of MP of 0, only hits enemies and does non-elemental damage. It's reliable."
    - "Blessing, which triggers at last digit of MP of 7, only hits the party and heals and Regens. It's also reliable."
    - "Second Rank Cleansing (3 MP) and Third Rank Blessing (7 MP) combo into each other infinitely if you don't want to think about it."
    - "Also note that !Predict won't ever cause enemies to counter. This includes annoying pests like Omega."
    - "Read Ahead is a passive that lowers the encounter rate. It's a solid time-saver that's totally useless for bosses. Kind of like Oracle."
  Cannoneer:
    - "A forbidden class you can normally only get in GBA and mobile once after getting all four tablets."
    - "Average stats and equipment access, but amazing abilities."
    - "!Open Fire is ridiculous early on, doing good damage and also randomly inflicting Poison/Blind/Confuse/Death. Fiesta Mod Cannoneers have it super easy."
    - "!Combine can only be used once you've actually unlocked Cannoneer, as the materials used for it are only sold in special shops that don't appear until then."
    - "Blitzshot+Dark Matter makes Chaos Cannon, which inflicts Death."
    - "Blitzshot+Iron Draft makes Vulner Cannon, which halves physical and magical defense and also doesn't trigger counterattacks."
    - "Blitzshot+Gold Needle makes Needle Cannon, which deals a flat 3000 damage. Useful for very high-defense targets."
    - "You can also set Berserk (Power Drink), Blind (Ash), Old (Speed Shake), Slow (Turtle Shell), and even Poison (Blastshot+Dark Matter.)"
