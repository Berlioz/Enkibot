W2 Exdeath:
  Metadata:
    next-node: antlion
    previous-nodes: ["scrubamesh"]
  Generic:
    - "32768 HP; phase transitions at 16000 and 7000 HP remaining."
    - "Classes without a strong way to cheese this fight should bring Reflect Rings from Barrier Tower."
    - "If you're foregoing Reflect Rings, don't have anyone with a level divisible by 3, unless you want them to die to Level 3 Flare."
    - "If you are bringing Reflect Rings, going in with a level divisible by 3 is actively good!"
    - "Parties with weak healing options (or anyone, honestly) should consider reading Exdeath's AI script to be ready for Zombie Breath, which wipe a party at low HP."
  White-Mage:
    - "Make sure you keep Protect up; Exdeath's Vacuum Wave physicals are nasty."
    - "Remember that you can't actually heal party members with a Reflect Ring, unless you have a way to also put Reflect on Exdeath."
    - "Setting Berserk on your own physical characters can help with the mad rush to take his last 7000 HP."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Level 2 Old works. If you know the timing well (once it lands, get six Can't Run messages), you can cast Level 5 Death at the right time to end the fight."
    - "That said, you may also want to consider stalling the first form long enough to learn Level 3 Flare. I personally don't but if you want to, that's cool too."
  UNION Beastmaster Blue-Mage:
    - "If you bothered to get Level 3 Flare before this fight, it's solid damage when you use it."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Do not use Slow. Exdeath will counter with Haste, which overwrites Slow instead of just cancelling it."
    - "Do use Float on your party to avoid Earth Shaker; even if Exdeath uses 100 Gs it just wastes a turn (and you can recast Float.)"
  UNION Time-Mage White-Mage:
    - "If you can Reflect Exdeath and bounce a Slow off your own party, the resulting Haste counter bounces off too."
  Summoner:
    - "Make sure you keep Golem up; Exdeath's Vacuum Wave physicals are nasty."
  Beastmaster:
    - "!Releasing four Yellow Dragons (8192 damage each) does 100% total."
  Ninja:
    - "Consider !Throwing the Excalipoor and the Fuma Shuriken from two floors down to get through Exdeath's last 7000 HP."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "Mystic Knights may have luck applying Drain Sword and just trying to DPS race."
  Bard:
    - "Going Super Saiyan on Exdeath with Swift Song is technically possible but tricky. Watch out for Condemn."
    - "On SNES and GBA, you can use !Hide to very, very slowly deplete Exdeath's MP. Doesn't work on Pixel and should, in general, be a strat of last resort."
  Chemist:
    - "Dragon's Kiss (Dragon Fang + Maiden's Kiss) blocks Condemn, allowing you to buff up in peace."
    - "Exdeath is weak to Holy; chugging a Goliath Tonic and then spamming Holy Breath (Dragon Fang + Holy Water) works well."
  Dancer:
    - "On Pixel, !Flirt works on this sentient humanoid tree spirit as well as anyone else for a total lockdown."
  Staff:
    - "Staff-wielding parties can grind for Staves of Light in Ghido's Cave; snapping them does about 4000 damage per Staff."
    - "This also takes forever and should very much be treated as a last resort - that said, it can be useful to quickly push Exdeath below 16000 for the phase change."
    - "If you're still relying on the Healing Staff, remember that it won't work on anyone wearing a Reflect Ring."
  UNION Staff Ranger:
    - "!Rapid Fire works with Staff of Light physical attacks. This obscurely specific tip sounds like a joke, but it isn't."
  Shield:
    - "Consider carefully what you give your Aegis Shield user; if things start going south they will likely be the one responsible for saving the fight."
