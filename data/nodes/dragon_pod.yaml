  Generic:
  - "12000 HP, summons 100 HP Dragon Flower that inflict various status effects."
  - "Most parties will either clear Flowers repeatedly with AoE or abuse the Pod's vulnerability to instant death."
  - "Worst case scenario, the Bone Mail shuts down almost everything this fight can do for one lucky wearer."
  - "Only the second Flower from the left inflicts an ailment that the Bone Mail doesn't nullify (paralyze)."
  - "The Flowers themselves have no status immunities, which is nice to know if you have to rely on the Bone Mail."
  Monk:
  - "This battle is probably the Monk's last gasp at viability. !Kick's time to shine is repeatedly clearing 100 HP idiots."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Summoner Ninja:
  - "Powerful target-all spells (or scrolls) will keep the Pod stuck resummoning its Flowers every turn."
  Black-Mage:
  - "The Flowers are also vulnerable to Sleep, though there's likely no reason to bother when you can just AoE them every turn."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "The Dragon Pod isn't Heavy, so you can just end this fight with a Death Claw."
  Berserker:
  - "If you can clear out the Flowers to keep them on-target, your Berserker will eventually kill the Pod with a Death Sickle."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Aquathorn from the swamps around Bal casts an instant death spell when !Released. It's only single-target, so kill the flowers first."
  - "If you don't want to walk out, you can !Catch a Bone Dragon right here, which casts Bone to take a single target down to single-digit HP."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Drain Sword bypasses the no-healing property of Bone Mail, allowing for an effortless Mystic Knight solo."
  Chemist:
  - "Death Potion works on the Dragon Pod."
  Bard:
  - "Bards can Stop all the Flowers (and the central Pod) at once with Romeo's Ballad."
  Dancer:
  - "The Dragon Pod isn't heavy, so you can lock it down with !Flirt."
  INTERSECTION Ranger Freelancer:
  - "The Killer Bow works on the Dragon Pod."
  Samurai:
  - "!Iainuki will cut the Dragon Pod right in half, if you have it."
  - "If not, the Wind Slash katana will clear the Flowers every time its Wind Slash ability procs (12.5%)."
  Geomancer:
  - "!Gaia is quite likely to use Earthquake here, which will kill the Flowers."
  INTERSECTION Red-Mage White-Mage:
  - "If you'd rather not snap rods, you can neuter the Flowers by Confusing them."
  Time-Mage:
  - "The Dragon Pod isn't heavy, so you can murder it with Gravity. You can also snap rods to clear the Flowers."
  Red-Mage:
  - "You can also snap rods to clear the Flowers."
