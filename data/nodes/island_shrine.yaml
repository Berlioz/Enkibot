  Generic:
  - "Consider carefully whether you actually need to do the various optional World 3 dungeons. Most parties don't!"
  - "The Island Shrine is required for Fork Tower, therefore also the Deep Sea Trench and Istory Falls."
  INTERSECTION Cannoneer Gladiator Oracle:
  - "And yes, this means it's mandatory to unlock Cannoneer, Gladiator, and Oracle. Sorry."
  Thief:
  - "The Island Shrine contains the Rising Sun, the best Thief-only weapon in the game (but you probably don't care.)"
  - "Additional Mirage Vests, which grant natural Blink, can be rarely stolen from Oiseaurares in the Shrine as well."
  UNION Thief Shield:
  - "You can steal more Ice Shields from Numb Blades here, if you have a use for them. Wendigo may be one."
  Beastmaster:
  - "If you're coming here for other reasons anyway, the Beast Killer whip can do a lot in a few fights later."
