  Generic:
  - "6500 HP, and will cast all three of Haste, Protect, and Shell at 2500 HP remaining, then spam Jump."
  - "This fight is much, much easier if you can prevent the buffs from being cast."
  - "In the SNES version only, you can try getting lucky with a Mage Masher proc right as you push Gilgamesh below 2500."
  - "Otherwise, most parties can still win a DPS race against boosted Gilgamesh, if you're careful about when you push him."
  White-Mage:
  - "Protect will let you safely slug it out against boosted Gilgamesh."
  Time-Mage:
  - "While he can't be silenced, the Mute spell works just fine."
  - "Land Slow on him before Mute stops your spells as well to make the fight even easier."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Blue Mages can Magic Hammer their way through Gilgamesh's 1000 MP before taking him below 2500 HP, causing his buffs to fail."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can deploy Bearagas saved from World 1, if you have any."
  UNION Blue-Mage Beastmaster:
  - "Alternatively, 1000 Needles still does its fixed damage even after his buffs."
  Dragoon:
  - "It'll take forever, but in the worst case scenario !Lance can be used to drain Gilgamesh's 1000 MP before taking him below 2500 HP, causing his buffs to fail."
  - "It's likely better to just kill him through them, for your own sanity."
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists can mix Lamia's Kiss and Dark Ether to effortlessly drain Gilgamesh's 1000 MP before taking him below 2500 HP, causing his buffs to fail."
  INTERSECTION Knight Mystic-Knight Blue-Mage Red-Mage Freelancer:
  - "Gilgamesh is vulnerable to Old, which you can inflict via the Ancient Sword. It's not vital, but ultimately cuts his Jump damage in half."
