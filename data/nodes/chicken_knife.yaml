  - "I've put an entire section here to remind you to get the Chicken Knife."
  - "It's in a hidden passage behind the shed next to the Pub in Moore."
  - "If you play like I do, the Chicken Knife is probably at 127 power already."
  - "Otherwise, just run away from fights until it is. If you left the Goblin chest in the Tule beginner's house alone, that's ideal."
  Bard:
  - "Also at this time, don't forget to pick up Mana's Paean on the top floor of the Library. It's very easy to miss this one forever."
  INTERSECTION Knight Freelancer Gladiator:
  - "You could, theoretically, get the Brave Blade and use it. But don't, unless maybe there's a toxx in the thread to raise charity cash."
