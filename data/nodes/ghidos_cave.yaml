  Generic:
  - "To advance the plot, take the submarine to visit Ghido's Cave."
  - "The correct order for the rock chest puzzle is top left, then press the switch, then bottom left, and continue."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "While you're there, learn Aeroga from the Enchanted Fan Metamorph, most common on B3."
  - "It's by far the most reliable option for Blue Mages to do straight damage, and boosted by the Air Knife."
  Staff:
  - "Your staff users may appreciate the Staff of Light that is 1/16 to drop from Metamorphs."
  - "Metamorphs will only drop this while in their base (old man) form. No transforms allowed."
  - "Farming copies to snap may make W2 Exdeath much easier, but it's also completely mind-numbing."
  Summoner:
  - "Summoners will want to stop by the Northern Island to fight Catoblepas."
  - "Catoblepas has only 5000 HP and only attacks with weak physicals or Drain."
  - "However, it also counterattacks with Petrify. Don't be afraid to stop attacking long enough to Gold Needle your team."
  - "HP Sap like, say, what a Summoner can inflict by snapping a Venom Rod, gets around this."
  Chemist:
  - "If you're running low on Turtle Shells for your Chemist, the best farming spot is the small patch of land just south of Moore, outside the mountains."
  - "The 3x Land Turtle encounters here drop more Turtle Shells to fuel your Succubus Kiss habit."
