    - chicken_knife
  Generic:
  - "To get in, you'll have to beat two Gargoyles with 5000 HP each which use physical attacks."
  - "If one is dead when the other gets a turn, it will revive at full HP, so you need to kill both nearly-simultaneously or use debilitating effects."
  - "Gargoyles are vulnerable to instant death, Sleep, Paralyze, Berserk, Stop, and Slow. (But they're heavy, so Paralyze and Stop don't last long.)"
  - "For subsequent rematches, you can use the Magic Lamp to run through Bahamut, Leviathan (sadly not Odin) and Syldra for enough AoE damage to usually kill both."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Blue Mages can use Level 3 Flare to kill both Gargoyles."
  White-Mage:
  - "Gargoyles are vulnerable to Berserk, and that prevents them from reviving each other."
  Staff:
  - "With a Power Staff, you can take advantage of the Gargoyles' vulnerability to Berserk even without access to the spell Berserk."
  Beastmaster:
  - "You don't have good !Catch options yet, but you can !Release Bulettes for ~4000 to a single random target."
  - "Four of them will kill both Gargoyles, so wait until all your ATB bars are full."
  INTERSECTION Thief Ninja Time-Mage:
  - "The Zephyrus encounters in here can be run from, but it takes forever naturally, so !Flee and !Smoke and the Teleport spell are really good."
  NOT INTERSECTION Thief Ninja Time-Mage:
  - "Without a run-away ability, regular Chicken Knife attacks are the best way to get away from Zephyrus encounters in a reasonable timeframe."
  Bard:
  - "Many of the random encounters in here are Undead, making Requiem very handy."
  Berserker:
  - "The Earth Hammer, an axe you can find here, has a Quake proc that runs off your magic, so it's very powerful with a mage secondary skill."
  - "On the SNES only, equipping the Thornlet will underflow a Berserker's Magic to 253, making Quake insanely powerful."
  INTERSECTION Dancer Freelancer:
  - "Another Ribbon can be found in a chest late in the Pyramid."
  INTERSECTION Chemist Cannoneer:
  - "There are total of six Dark Matters in chests here, which should be enough to get you through the rest of the game."
  - "If you need more, Prototype Island close to Crescent is still around."
