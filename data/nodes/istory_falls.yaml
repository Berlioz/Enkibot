Istory Falls:
  Metadata:
    next-node: leviathan
    previous-nodes:
    - those_assholes
  Generic:
  - "Istory Falls isn't useless per se. There's a lot of good loot in here, but it rarely makes or breaks a run."
  INTERSECTION Cannoneer Gladiator Oracle:
  - "It is, however, mandatory to unlock Cannoneer, Gladiator, and Oracle."
  Summoner:
  - "Summoners learn Leviathan here which is... completely useless due to the lack of water-boosting weapons."
  UNION Summoner Chemist:
  - "...unless you have Chemist, whose Elemental Power mix can boost Water spells. EP Leviathan is the second strongest spell and strongest AoE in the game."
  INTERSECTION Blue-Mage Red-Mage:
  - "The Enhancer available in Istory Falls boosts Magic for the Blue and Red Mages that can equip it."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "The Enhancer available in Istory Falls is the best Spellblade-compatible weapon that's not the Chicken Knife."
  - "That said, A) you probably will be using the Chicken Knife, and B) you can also get Enhancers in the Rift Castle via rare steal with the Thief Knife."
  Ranger:
  - "Rangers can get the Artemis Bow here, which is still worse than !Rapid Fire with the Chicken Knife."
  - "That said, if you've got a second !Rapid Fire user taking up your Chicken Knife, it's probably the best option."
  Shield:
  - "The Aegis Shield here is the real reason to run Istory. Having two Aegis Shields is huge if you have two Shield wearers."
